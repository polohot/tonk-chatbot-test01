All settings made in the single F-system must also be made in the fault-tolerant F-system.

Note

Parameters in blue can be changed during operation on an H system.

The following settings must also be made when using redundant CPUs:

- Reaction to RAM/PIQ comparison error
- Cyclic interrupt OB with special handling
- Monitoring times

# 6.2.1 Reaction to RAM/PIQ comparison error

Troubleshooting

TROUBLESHOOTING mode is set by default in response to a comparison error (default response). The purpose of troubleshooting is to locate a faulty CPU.

Select how the H system should react to an error generated during the comparison of the RAM areas and the process images of the outputs:

- Troubleshooting: TROUBLESHOOTING mode can only be reached from the ""Redundant"" system state. If an error occurs in redundant mode and depending on the error, one of the CPUs goes into TROUBLESHOOTING mode and performs a full self-test. The other CPU becomes the master. If a hardware error is detected, the CPU goes to DEFECTIVE mode. If no error is detected, the CPU is coupled again. The H system goes back into the ""Redundant"" system state. This is followed by an automatic master-standby switchover. This ensures that when the next error is detected in troubleshooting mode, the hardware of the previous master CPU is tested.

Parameters in blue can be changed during operation on an H system.

The following settings must also be made when using redundant CPUs:

- Reaction to RAM/PIQ comparison error

# 6.2.1 Reaction to RAM/PIQ comparison error

Troubleshooting

TROUBLESHOOTING mode is set by default in response to a comparison error (default response). The purpose of troubleshooting is to locate a faulty CPU.

Select how the H system should react to an error generated during the comparison of the RAM areas and the process images of the outputs:

- Troubleshooting: TROUBLESHOOTING mode can only be reached from the ""Redundant"" system state. If an error occurs in redundant mode and depending on the error, one of the CPUs goes into TROUBLESHOOTING mode and performs a full self-test. The other CPU becomes the master. If a hardware error is detected, the CPU goes to DEFECTIVE mode. If no error is detected, the CPU is coupled again. The H system goes back into the ""Redundant"" system state. This is followed by an automatic master-standby switchover. This ensures that when the next error is detected in troubleshooting mode, the hardware of the previous master CPU is tested.

All settings made in the single F-system must also be made in the fault-tolerant F-system.

Note

Parameters in blue can be changed during operation on an H system.

The following settings must also be made when using redundant CPUs:

- Reaction to RAM/PIQ comparison error
- Cyclic interrupt OB with special handling
- Monitoring times

# 6.2.1 Reaction to RAM/PIQ comparison error

Troubleshooting

TROUBLESHOOTING mode is set by default in response to a comparison error (default response). The purpose of troubleshooting is to locate a faulty CPU.

Select how the H system should react to an error generated during the comparison of the RAM areas and the process images of the outputs:

- Troubleshooting: TROUBLESHOOTING mode can only be reached from the ""Redundant"" system state. If an error occurs in redundant mode and depending on the error, one of the CPUs goes into TROUBLESHOOTING mode and performs a full self-test. The other CPU becomes the master. If a hardware error is detected, the CPU goes to DEFECTIVE mode. If no error is detected, the CPU is coupled again. The H system goes back into the ""Redundant"" system state. This is followed by an automatic master-standby switchover. This ensures that when the next error is detected in troubleshooting mode, the hardware of the previous master CPU is tested.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

All settings made in the single F-system must also be made in the fault-tolerant F-system.

Note

Parameters in blue can be changed during operation on an H system.

The following settings must also be made when using redundant CPUs:

- Reaction to RAM/PIQ comparison error
- Cyclic interrupt OB with special handling
- Monitoring times

# 6.2.1 Reaction to RAM/PIQ comparison error

Troubleshooting

TROUBLESHOOTING mode is set by default in response to a comparison error (default response). The purpose of troubleshooting is to locate a faulty CPU.

Select how the H system should react to an error generated during the comparison of the RAM areas and the process images of the outputs:

- Troubleshooting: TROUBLESHOOTING mode can only be reached from the ""Redundant"" system state. If an error occurs in redundant mode and depending on the error, one of the CPUs goes into TROUBLESHOOTING mode and performs a full self-test. The other CPU becomes the master. If a hardware error is detected, the CPU goes to DEFECTIVE mode. If no error is detected, the CPU is coupled again. The H system goes back into the ""Redundant"" system state. This is followed by an automatic master-standby switchover. This ensures that when the next error is detected in troubleshooting mode, the hardware of the previous master CPU is tested.

Note

The events that trigger TROUBLESHOOTING mode are described in the following manuals:

All settings made in the single F-system must also be made in the fault-tolerant F-system.

Note

Parameters in blue can be changed during operation on an H system.

The following settings must also be made when using redundant CPUs:

- Reaction to RAM/PIQ comparison error
- Cyclic interrupt OB with special handling
- Monitoring times

# 6.2.1 Reaction to RAM/PIQ comparison error

Troubleshooting

TROUBLESHOOTING mode is set by default in response to a comparison error (default response). The purpose of troubleshooting is to locate a faulty CPU.

Select how the H system should react to an error generated during the comparison of the RAM areas and the process images of the outputs:

- Troubleshooting: TROUBLESHOOTING mode can only be reached from the ""Redundant"" system state. If an error occurs in redundant mode and depending on the error, one of the CPUs goes into TROUBLESHOOTING mode and performs a full self-test. The other CPU becomes the master. If a hardware error is detected, the CPU goes to DEFECTIVE mode. If no error is detected, the CPU is coupled again. The H system goes back into the ""Redundant"" system state. This is followed by an automatic master-standby switchover. This ensures that when the next error is detected in troubleshooting mode, the hardware of the previous master CPU is tested.

Select how the H system should react to an error generated during the comparison of the RAM areas and the process images of the outputs:

- Troubleshooting: TROUBLESHOOTING mode can only be reached from the ""Redundant"" system state. If an error occurs in redundant mode and depending on the error, one of the CPUs goes into TROUBLESHOOTING mode and performs a full self-test. The other CPU becomes the master. If a hardware error is detected, the CPU goes to DEFECTIVE mode. If no error is detected, the CPU is coupled again. The H system goes back into the ""Redundant"" system state. This is followed by an automatic master-standby switchover. This ensures that when the next error is detected in troubleshooting mode, the hardware of the previous master CPU is tested.

Note

The events that trigger TROUBLESHOOTING mode are described in the following manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/82478488)""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748473)""
