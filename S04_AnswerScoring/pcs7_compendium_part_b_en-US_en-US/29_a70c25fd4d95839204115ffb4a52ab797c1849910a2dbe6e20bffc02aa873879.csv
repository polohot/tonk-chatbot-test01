# Discrepancy handling (analog inputs)

In the processing industry, no evaluation is generally performed between 2 signals on the module. 1oo1 is set for sensor evaluation. This makes all the signals available in the user program, where they can be linked in 1oo2 or 2oo3, depending on what is required.

# Measuring range

The measuring ranges 0 to 20 mA and 4 to 20 mA are available for selection. With 0 to 20 mA, HART communication is not possible.

# F wire-break detection

In the 4 to 20 mA measuring range and with wire-break detection activated, a message is issued when a current of < 3.6 mA is present. If wire-break detection is deactivated, an underflow message is issued if a current of < 0.4444 mA is present (as with the 0 to 20 mA measuring range).

# Filter

The module filters the input signal throughout the specified number of acquisition cycles. Please note that input signal filtering will lengthen the system's reaction time.
