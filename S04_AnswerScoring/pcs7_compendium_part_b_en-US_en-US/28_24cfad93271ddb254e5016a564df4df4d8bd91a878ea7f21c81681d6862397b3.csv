The measurement type depends on the operating mode selected. The operating mode can be selected for each channel. In safety mode the following measurement types are available:

- ""2DMU"" or ""4DMU"" for current measurements. (4 to 20mA)
- ""Deactivated"": The channel is not processed by the module.

# Measuring range

The selection options in the measuring range field vary depending on the selected mode (safety mode activated or deactivated) as well as the measurement type. If a channel is deactivated, it will not be possible to select a measuring range.

Note
If you are using Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs), you should select 4DMU for the configuration, since the supply is provided via the MTAs.

Note
In safety mode, only the 4 to 20 mA measuring range is permitted. In this measuring range, a current of < 3.6 mA will produce a wire-break signal. If, however, the type of sensor you are using (e.g. a gas sensor) means that you do need to process signals that fall below this range, you can deactivate F wire-break detection. In this case, a current of < 1.18 mA will produce an underflow message.

For more information, please refer to the following FAQ: ""How can process signals that are less than 4 mA be used with a 4 to 20 mA analog input module (F technology)?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/23707365).

If, however, the type of sensor you are using (e.g. a gas sensor) means that you do need to process signals that fall below this range, you can deactivate F wire-break detection. In this case, a current of < 1.18 mA will produce an underflow message.

For more information, please refer to the following FAQ: ""How can process signals that are less than 4 mA be used with a 4 to 20 mA analog input module (F technology)?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/23707365).

In the processing industry, no evaluation is generally performed between 2 signals on the module. 1oo1 is set for sensor evaluation. This makes all the signals available in the user program, where they can be linked in 1oo2 or 2oo3, depending on what is required. If 1oo2 evaluation is to be implemented on the module, you can find the parameter description for discrepancy handling in the online help.

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# HART gate

This enables HART communication with the transducers to be controlled. ON/OFF switches HART communication on or off for the entire module, in a safety-related manner. If ""Can be switched"" is set here, HART communication may be enabled or disabled on the F-channel driver.

# Interference frequency suppression

Setting interference frequency suppression for the line frequency. The corresponding integration time of the analog digital converter is displayed. If you change this setting, the increment for the F-monitoring time and for the discrepancy times will also change automatically. The values set there will be adjusted to the next lowest value.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 evaluation: Each channel is considered individually and the input value forwarded to the CPU.
- 1oo2 evaluation: 2 channels are combined in all cases (0/3, 1/4, and 2/5). A discrepancy analysis is performed on the module and the configured input value is forwarded to the CPU.

The measurement type depends on the operating mode selected. The operating mode can be selected for each channel. In safety mode the following measurement types are available:

- ""2DMU"" or ""4DMU"" for current measurements. (4 to 20mA)
- ""Deactivated"": The channel is not processed by the module.

# Measuring range

The selection options in the measuring range field vary depending on the selected mode (safety mode activated or deactivated) as well as the measurement type. If a channel is deactivated, it will not be possible to select a measuring range.

Note
If you are using Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs), you should select 4DMU for the configuration, since the supply is provided via the MTAs.

Note
In safety mode, only the 4 to 20 mA measuring range is permitted. In this measuring range, a current of < 3.6 mA will produce a wire-break signal. If, however, the type of sensor you are using (e.g. a gas sensor) means that you do need to process signals that fall below this range, you can deactivate F wire-break detection. In this case, a current of < 1.18 mA will produce an underflow message.

For more information, please refer to the following FAQ: ""How can process signals that are less than 4 mA be used with a 4 to 20 mA analog input module (F technology)?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/23707365).

The measurement type depends on the operating mode selected. The operating mode can be selected for each channel. In safety mode the following measurement types are available:

- ""2DMU"" or ""4DMU"" for current measurements. (4 to 20mA)
- ""Deactivated"": The channel is not processed by the module.

# Measuring range

The selection options in the measuring range field vary depending on the selected mode (safety mode activated or deactivated) as well as the measurement type. If a channel is deactivated, it will not be possible to select a measuring range.

Note
If you are using Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs), you should select 4DMU for the configuration, since the supply is provided via the MTAs.

Note
In safety mode, only the 4 to 20 mA measuring range is permitted. In this measuring range, a current of < 3.6 mA will produce a wire-break signal. If, however, the type of sensor you are using (e.g. a gas sensor) means that you do need to process signals that fall below this range, you can deactivate F wire-break detection. In this case, a current of < 1.18 mA will produce an underflow message.

For more information, please refer to the following FAQ: ""How can process signals that are less than 4 mA be used with a 4 to 20 mA analog input module (F technology)?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/23707365).

In safety mode, only the 4 to 20 mA measuring range is permitted. In this measuring range, a current of < 3.6 mA will produce a wire-break signal. If, however, the type of sensor you are using (e.g. a gas sensor) means that you do need to process signals that fall below this range, you can deactivate F wire-break detection. In this case, a current of < 1.18 mA will produce an underflow message.

For more information, please refer to the following FAQ: ""How can process signals that are less than 4 mA be used with a 4 to 20 mA analog input module (F technology)?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/23707365).

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# HART gate

This enables HART communication with the transducers to be controlled. ON/OFF switches HART communication on or off for the entire module, in a safety-related manner. If ""Can be switched"" is set here, HART communication may be enabled or disabled on the F-channel driver.

# Interference frequency suppression

Setting interference frequency suppression for the line frequency. The corresponding integration time of the analog digital converter is displayed. If you change this setting, the increment for the F-monitoring time and for the discrepancy times will also change automatically. The values set there will be adjusted to the next lowest value.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 evaluation: Each channel is considered individually and the input value forwarded to the CPU.
- 1oo2 evaluation: 2 channels are combined in all cases (0/3, 1/4, and 2/5). A discrepancy analysis is performed on the module and the configured input value is forwarded to the CPU. ",What is the default sensor evaluation setting in the processing industry for analog inputs?,A2,"The standard sensor evaluation in the processing industry is 1oo1, allowing signals to be linked in the user program as needed.",2.15625,2.1875,3.515625,1.484375,0.56640625

The measurement type depends on the operating mode selected. The operating mode can be selected for each channel. In safety mode the following measurement types are available:

- ""2DMU"" or ""4DMU"" for current measurements. (4 to 20mA)
- ""Deactivated"": The channel is not processed by the module.

# Measuring range

The selection options in the measuring range field vary depending on the selected mode (safety mode activated or deactivated) as well as the measurement type. If a channel is deactivated, it will not be possible to select a measuring range.

Note
If you are using Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs), you should select 4DMU for the configuration, since the supply is provided via the MTAs.

Note
In safety mode, only the 4 to 20 mA measuring range is permitted. In this measuring range, a current of < 3.6 mA will produce a wire-break signal. If, however, the type of sensor you are using (e.g. a gas sensor) means that you do need to process signals that fall below this range, you can deactivate F wire-break detection. In this case, a current of < 1.18 mA will produce an underflow message.

For more information, please refer to the following FAQ: ""How can process signals that are less than 4 mA be used with a 4 to 20 mA analog input module (F technology)?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/23707365).

In the processing industry, no evaluation is generally performed between 2 signals on the module. 1oo1 is set for sensor evaluation. This makes all the signals available in the user program, where they can be linked in 1oo2 or 2oo3, depending on what is required.

The measurement type depends on the operating mode selected. The operating mode can be selected for each channel. In safety mode the following measurement types are available:

- ""2DMU"" or ""4DMU"" for current measurements. (4 to 20mA)
- ""Deactivated"": The channel is not processed by the module.

# Measuring range

The selection options in the measuring range field vary depending on the selected mode (safety mode activated or deactivated) as well as the measurement type. If a channel is deactivated, it will not be possible to select a measuring range.

Note
If you are using Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs), you should select 4DMU for the configuration, since the supply is provided via the MTAs.

Note
In safety mode, only the 4 to 20 mA measuring range is permitted. In this measuring range, a current of < 3.6 mA will produce a wire-break signal. If, however, the type of sensor you are using (e.g. a gas sensor) means that you do need to process signals that fall below this range, you can deactivate F wire-break detection. In this case, a current of < 1.18 mA will produce an underflow message.

For more information, please refer to the following FAQ: ""How can process signals that are less than 4 mA be used with a 4 to 20 mA analog input module (F technology)?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/23707365).

- ""2DMU"" or ""4DMU"" for current measurements. (4 to 20mA)
- ""Deactivated"": The channel is not processed by the module.

# Measuring range

The selection options in the measuring range field vary depending on the selected mode (safety mode activated or deactivated) as well as the measurement type. If a channel is deactivated, it will not be possible to select a measuring range.

Note
If you are using Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs), you should select 4DMU for the configuration, since the supply is provided via the MTAs.

Note
In safety mode, only the 4 to 20 mA measuring range is permitted. In this measuring range, a current of < 3.6 mA will produce a wire-break signal. If, however, the type of sensor you are using (e.g. a gas sensor) means that you do need to process signals that fall below this range, you can deactivate F wire-break detection. In this case, a current of < 1.18 mA will produce an underflow message.

For more information, please refer to the following FAQ: ""How can process signals that are less than 4 mA be used with a 4 to 20 mA analog input module (F technology)?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/23707365).

In the processing industry, no evaluation is generally performed between 2 signals on the module. 1oo1 is set for sensor evaluation. This makes all the signals available in the user program, where they can be linked in 1oo2 or 2oo3, depending on what is required. If 1oo2 evaluation is to be implemented on the module, you can find the parameter description for discrepancy handling in the online help.
