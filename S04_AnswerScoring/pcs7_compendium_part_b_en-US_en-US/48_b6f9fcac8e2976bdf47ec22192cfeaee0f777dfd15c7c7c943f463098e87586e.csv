A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block.

Using the MOS function, up to three BOOL values from the OS can be activated or deactivated and a further BOOL or REAL value can be entered. For each value there is a block (""F_SWC_BO"", ""F_SWC_R"") in the AS to which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output for visualization of the current value is interconnected to the ""SWC_MOS"" block.

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW.

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block.

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block.

Using the MOS function, up to three BOOL values from the OS can be activated or deactivated and a further BOOL or REAL value can be entered. For each value there is a block (""F_SWC_BO"", ""F_SWC_R"") in the AS to which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output for visualization of the current value is interconnected to the ""SWC_MOS"" block. The ""F_SWC_BO"" blocks have an input for setting and an input for resetting values, whereby the output value can also be controlled by the safety program. For each of these three BOOL values, a further two BOOL or REAL values for the display can be interconnected to the ""SWC_MOS2"" block (inputs: ""VMOD_BxB"", ""Q_BxB"" or ""VMOD_BxR"", ""V_BxR""). Function-related names should be assigned to the ""F_SWC_BO"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.
