# 11.6.15 Error 14: EtherCAT error

# 11.6.15.1 Error 14-1 (emergency code 8130h)

Cause: ECAT watchdog timeout, Sync manager 0/1 watchdog error

Suggested steps:

- This is possibly a hardware issue
- This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.
- The device was probably disconnected from the master controller, or the master is overloaded.

Please check the device cabling for proper connection.

Please check device grounding, i.e. the connection to a metal backplane and cabinet connection to earth.

Check motor grounding and motor cable length.

Please check the bus system connection. Try to replace the cables.

Please try to reduce computational load on the master.

Try to increase the master cycle time.

# 11.6.15 Error 14: EtherCAT error

# 11.6.15.1 Error 14-1 (emergency code 8130h)

Cause: ECAT watchdog timeout, Sync manager 0/1 watchdog error

Suggested steps:

- This is possibly a hardware issue
- This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.
- The device was probably disconnected from the master controller, or the master is overloaded.

Please check the device cabling for proper connection.

Please check device grounding, i.e. the connection to a metal backplane and cabinet connection to earth.

Check motor grounding and motor cable length.

Please check the bus system connection. Try to replace the cables.

Please try to reduce computational load on the master.

Try to increase the master cycle time.
