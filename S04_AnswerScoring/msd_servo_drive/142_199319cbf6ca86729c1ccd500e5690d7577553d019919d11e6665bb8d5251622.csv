# 11.6.16.16 Error 15-17 (emergency code FF00h)

Cause: Autotuning mode not supported (in this configuration)

# Suggested steps:

Please use other autotuning mode or tune by hand

# 11.6.16.17 Error 15-18 (emergency code FF00h)

Cause: Error in power fail initialization

# Suggested steps:

Check power fail parameters or disable function

# 11.6.16.18 Error 15-19 (emergency code FF00h)

Cause: Error in camming or electronic gearing initialization

# Suggested steps:

Check parameter or IEC configuration

# 11.6.16.19 Error 15-20 (emergency code FF00h)

Cause: Error in configuration of CAM module

# Suggested steps:

Check for even number of configured cam edges. All configured cam edges have to be in ascending order.

# 11.6.16.20 Error 15-21 (emergency code FF00h)

Cause: Dataset to be loaded is not valid
