Movement requested which was limited by reversing lock, limit switch or reference value limitation.

# Suggested steps:

- Quit error and change reference value
- The reference value violates a lock or limit switch. Please check reference values. If this axis is working in cyclic synchronous mode, make a scope record.
- Check factor group settings.
