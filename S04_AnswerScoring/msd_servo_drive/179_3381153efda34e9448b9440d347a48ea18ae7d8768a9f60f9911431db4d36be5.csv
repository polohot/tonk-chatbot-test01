Cause: Positive hardware limit switch (LSW_P) detected

# Suggested steps:

Check your hardware

- Position was limited internally.
- Please check factor group setting and position command.
- Take a scope record to determine if the position control overshoots.

There is a problem with the digital/analog inputs

- Please check the 24V I/O wiring, function assignment and inversion parameters.
- Please check connected switches for chattering. Consider using the input filter.

The speed control might run away, most likely due to a wrong encoder offset.

- Please check that the encoder offset is set properly.
- If auto commutation is used, re-view the auto commutation setting and test under all possible conditions.
- If torque mode is used, reduce torque, ensure external speed limitation, or increase speed control gain for stronger limitation.

There is a problem with the digital/analog inputs

- Please check the 24V I/O wiring, function assignment and inversion parameters.
- Please check connected switches for chattering. Consider using the input filter.

The speed control might run away, most likely due to a wrong encoder offset.

- Please check that the encoder offset is set properly.
- If auto commutation is used, re-view the auto commutation setting and test under all possible conditions.
- If torque mode is used, reduce torque, ensure external speed limitation, or increase speed control gain for stronger limitation.

- Please check the 24V I/O wiring, function assignment and inversion parameters.
- Please check connected switches for chattering. Consider using the input filter.

The speed control might run away, most likely due to a wrong encoder offset.

- Please check that the encoder offset is set properly.
- If auto commutation is used, re-view the auto commutation setting and test under all possible conditions.
- If torque mode is used, reduce torque, ensure external speed limitation, or increase speed control gain for stronger limitation.
