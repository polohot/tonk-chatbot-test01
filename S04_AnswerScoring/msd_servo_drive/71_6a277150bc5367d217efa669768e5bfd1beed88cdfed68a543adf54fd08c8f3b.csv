If there is no analytical description available for a function, and only individual points are known instead, it will not be possible to evaluate the function at just any point.

Here two given datum points f0 and f1 are connected by a line. To n+1 differing datum point pairs there is exactly one n-th order interpolation polynomial, which matches at the specified interpolation points.

# 8.3.6.2 Cubic interpolation

As polynomials become more and more unstable as the order of magnitude increases – that is to say, fluctuate widely between the interpolation points – in practice polynomials of an order greater than 5 are rarely applied. Instead, large data sets are interpolated in chunks.

In the case of linear interpolation, that would be a frequency polygon; in the case of 2nd or 3rd order polynomials the usual term used is spline interpolation. In the case of sectionally defined interpolants, the question of consistency and differentiation at the interpolation points is of major importance.

# 8.3.6.1 Linear interpolation

If there is no analytical description available for a function, and only individual points are known instead, it will not be possible to evaluate the function at just any point.

Here two given datum points f0 and f1 are connected by a line. To n+1 differing datum point pairs there is exactly one n-th order interpolation polynomial, which matches at the specified interpolation points.

# 8.3.6.2 Cubic interpolation

As polynomials become more and more unstable as the order of magnitude increases – that is to say, fluctuate widely between the interpolation points – in practice polynomials of an order greater than 5 are rarely applied. Instead, large data sets are interpolated in chunks.

In the case of linear interpolation, that would be a frequency polygon; in the case of 2nd or 3rd order polynomials the usual term used is spline interpolation. In the case of sectionally defined interpolants, the question of consistency and differentiation at the interpolation points is of major importance.

If there is no analytical description available for a function, and only individual points are known instead, it will not be possible to evaluate the function at just any point.

Here two given datum points f0 and f1 are connected by a line. To n+1 differing datum point pairs there is exactly one n-th order interpolation polynomial, which matches at the specified interpolation points.

|370|0|CON_IP| |Interpolation type in IP mode|
| | |NoIp(0)| |The values are transferred 1:1 to reference processing in 1 ms cycles.|
| | |Lin (1)| |In the linear interpolation method the acceleration between two points is generally zero. Pre-control of the acceleration values is thus not possible and speed jumps are always caused.|
| | |SplineExtFF(2)| |Interpolation with external pre-control: Only on request from Moog.|

| |NonIPSpline(4)|Cubic spline approximation:| |In this method the interpolation points are approximated by means of B-splines. The trajectory normally does not run exactly through the points specified by the control.
