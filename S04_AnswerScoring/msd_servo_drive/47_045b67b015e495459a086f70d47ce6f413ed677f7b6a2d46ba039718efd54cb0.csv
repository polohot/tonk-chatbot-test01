Position controller see 7.5 Position controller settings When using a standard Moog motor data set, the control parameters are preset for the specific motor model (external mass inertia = motor inertia). If using third-party motors, a manual setting must be made for the drive by way of the motor identification or by calculation in order to define the appropriate control parameters for the motor model.

Current Controller see 7.3 Torque controller

Field weakening, asynchronous see 7.6 Asynchronous motor field weakening

Field weakening, synchronous see 7.7 Field weakening and LookUpTable (LUT), synchronous motor

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

# 7.1.1.1 Speed control loop

Scanning times of the individual control circuits:

|Switching frequency|Current Controller|Sampling time|Speed controller|Position controller|

Table 7.1: Scanning times of the individual control circuits

The control system is set up in a cascaded configuration. The position, speed and current controllers are configured in sequence. The sequence of controller setup must always be observed in controller optimization.

2. Speed controller setup

# 7.2 Basic settings

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# 7.2.1 Motor control basic settings

Click on the ""Basic settings"" button opens the wizard to determine the mass inertia, the rigidity wizard, as well as the speed and position controllers.

NOTE

- P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon specifies the control mode with which the drive is to be run. This parameter takes effect online. Uncontrolled online switching can cause an extreme jerk, a very high speed or an overcurrent, which may cause damage to the system.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# NOTE

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

# 7.3 Torque controller

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.2 Creating the transfer function

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

① Green curve = amount

Y-axis left = absolute value of isd/isdref

② Blue curve = phase response

Y-axis right = Phase response Isd/isdref

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

Position controller see 7.5 Position controller settings When using a standard Moog motor data set, the control parameters are preset for the specific motor model (external mass inertia = motor inertia). If using third-party motors, a manual setting must be made for the drive by way of the motor identification or by calculation in order to define the appropriate control parameters for the motor model.

Speed controller see 7.4 Speed controller

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3 Torque controller

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.2 Creating the transfer function

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

② Blue curve = phase response

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3 Torque controller

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.2 Creating the transfer function

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

② Blue curve = phase response

Y-axis right = Phase response Isd/isdref

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

If using third-party motors, a manual setting must be made for the drive by way of the motor identification or by calculation in order to define the appropriate control parameters for the motor model.

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

NOTE

- P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon specifies the control mode with which the drive is to be run. This parameter takes effect online. Uncontrolled online switching can cause an extreme jerk, a very high speed or an overcurrent, which may cause damage to the system.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

Position controller see 7.5 Position controller settings When using a standard Moog motor data set, the control parameters are preset for the specific motor model (external mass inertia = motor inertia). If using third-party motors, a manual setting must be made for the drive by way of the motor identification or by calculation in order to define the appropriate control parameters for the motor model.

Field weakening, asynchronous see 7.6 Asynchronous motor field weakening

Field weakening, synchronous see 7.7 Field weakening and LookUpTable (LUT), synchronous motor

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

# 7.1.1.1 Speed control loop

The control system is set up in a cascaded configuration. The position, speed and current controllers are configured in sequence. The sequence of controller setup must always be observed in controller optimization.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3 Torque controller

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.2 Creating the transfer function

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

① Green curve = amount

② Blue curve = phase response

Y-axis right = Phase response Isd/isdref

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

If using third-party motors, a manual setting must be made for the drive by way of the motor identification or by calculation in order to define the appropriate control parameters for the motor model.

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# 7.2.1 Motor control basic settings

Click on the ""Basic settings"" button opens the wizard to determine the mass inertia, the rigidity wizard, as well as the speed and position controllers.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# NOTE

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

# 7.3 Torque controller

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.2 Creating the transfer function

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

① Green curve = amount

Y-axis left = absolute value of isd/isdref

② Blue curve = phase response

Y-axis right = Phase response Isd/isdref

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

Conversely, the measurement variable remains low until another zero pulse appears. Bear in mind that the pulse width of the scope signal does not match the pulse width of the actual zero pulse.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

② Blue curve = phase response

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

If using third-party motors, a manual setting must be made for the drive by way of the motor identification or by calculation in order to define the appropriate control parameters for the motor model.

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.

Position controller see 7.5 Position controller settings When using a standard Moog motor data set, the control parameters are preset for the specific motor model (external mass inertia = motor inertia). If using third-party motors, a manual setting must be made for the drive by way of the motor identification or by calculation in order to define the appropriate control parameters for the motor model.

Field weakening, asynchronous see 7.6 Asynchronous motor field weakening

Field weakening, synchronous see 7.7 Field weakening and LookUpTable (LUT), synchronous motor

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

# 7.1.1.1 Speed control loop

The control system is set up in a cascaded configuration. The position, speed and current controllers are configured in sequence. The sequence of controller setup must always be observed in controller optimization.

# 7.2 Basic settings

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# 7.2.1 Motor control basic settings

Click on the ""Basic settings"" button opens the wizard to determine the mass inertia, the rigidity wizard, as well as the speed and position controllers.

NOTE

- P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon specifies the control mode with which the drive is to be run. This parameter takes effect online. Uncontrolled online switching can cause an extreme jerk, a very high speed or an overcurrent, which may cause damage to the system.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3 Torque controller

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.2 Creating the transfer function

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

② Blue curve = phase response

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3 Torque controller

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.2 Creating the transfer function

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

① Green curve = amount

Y-axis left = absolute value of isd/isdref

② Blue curve = phase response

Y-axis right = Phase response Isd/isdref

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

Conversely, the measurement variable remains low until another zero pulse appears. Bear in mind that the pulse width of the scope signal does not match the pulse width of the actual zero pulse.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.

Position controller see 7.5 Position controller settings When using a standard Moog motor data set, the control parameters are preset for the specific motor model (external mass inertia = motor inertia). If using third-party motors, a manual setting must be made for the drive by way of the motor identification or by calculation in order to define the appropriate control parameters for the motor model.

Field weakening, asynchronous see 7.6 Asynchronous motor field weakening

Field weakening, synchronous see 7.7 Field weakening and LookUpTable (LUT), synchronous motor

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

# 7.1.1.1 Speed control loop

The control system is set up in a cascaded configuration. The position, speed and current controllers are configured in sequence. The sequence of controller setup must always be observed in controller optimization.

# 7.2 Basic settings

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

Click on the ""Basic settings"" button opens the wizard to determine the mass inertia, the rigidity wizard, as well as the speed and position controllers.

NOTE

- P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon specifies the control mode with which the drive is to be run. This parameter takes effect online. Uncontrolled online switching can cause an extreme jerk, a very high speed or an overcurrent, which may cause damage to the system.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3 Torque controller

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.2 Creating the transfer function

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

② Blue curve = phase response

Y-axis right = Phase response Isd/isdref

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3 Torque controller

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.2 Creating the transfer function

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

① Green curve = amount

Y-axis left = absolute value of isd/isdref

② Blue curve = phase response

Y-axis right = Phase response Isd/isdref

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved. ",What is the effect of setting the rigidity to less than 100% in the 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp' document?,A1,It reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting.,2.28125,2.3125,3.4375,1.2265625,0.298828125

Conversely, the measurement variable remains low until another zero pulse appears. Bear in mind that the pulse width of the scope signal does not match the pulse width of the actual zero pulse.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

NOTE

- P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon specifies the control mode with which the drive is to be run. This parameter takes effect online. Uncontrolled online switching can cause an extreme jerk, a very high speed or an overcurrent, which may cause damage to the system.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.

Position controller see 7.5 Position controller settings When using a standard Moog motor data set, the control parameters are preset for the specific motor model (external mass inertia = motor inertia). If using third-party motors, a manual setting must be made for the drive by way of the motor identification or by calculation in order to define the appropriate control parameters for the motor model.

Field weakening, asynchronous see 7.6 Asynchronous motor field weakening

Field weakening, synchronous see 7.7 Field weakening and LookUpTable (LUT), synchronous motor

The setting of the speed controller with the associated filters is dependent on the motor parameters (moment of inertia, torque/force constant, load inertia/mass, friction, rigidity of the connection and encoder quality). Consequently, a manual or automatic optimization is often required.

# 7.1.1.1 Speed control loop

The control system is set up in a cascaded configuration. The position, speed and current controllers are configured in sequence. The sequence of controller setup must always be observed in controller optimization.

2. Speed controller setup

# 7.2 Basic settings

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# 7.2.1 Motor control basic settings

Click on the ""Basic settings"" button opens the wizard to determine the mass inertia, the rigidity wizard, as well as the speed and position controllers.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3 Torque controller

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.2 Creating the transfer function

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner.

The basic settings for the control are selected and parametrized using the ""Motor control setup"" screen. This screen aids navigation to the basic settings, various controllers and the control mode.

Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

- Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

Image 7.4: “Determining the mass inertia” screen

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3 Torque controller

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.2 Creating the transfer function

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

① Green curve = amount

Y-axis left = absolute value of isd/isdref

② Blue curve = phase response

Y-axis right = Phase response Isd/isdref

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.

# 7.2.1.1 Adjustment of the mass inertia

The speed controller gain is scaled separately using the percentage value KP Scale. The damping of the control is affected by the speed filter. If the mass inertia value is not known, the wizard can be used to determine it (see Section ""Automatic inertia detection"" on page 111).

Useful settings are:

- Resolver: 1-2 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (low-track): 0.5 - 1 ms
- Sin/Cos encoder (high resolution): 0.2 - 0.6 ms

While the mass inertia is being determined the motor executes movements. There is a risk that the system and the motor may be destroyed.

NOTE

After a power-off the speed and position control settings remain stored. The percentage value for rigidity, however, is set to 100% again.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

# 7.2.2 Automatic inertia detection

To define the mass inertia of a motor easily, the ""automatic mass inertia definition"" function is available. In the standard motor data set, the speed controller is preset for a moderately stiff mechanical system. The automatic mass inertia definition function is started when the hardware has been enabled. Clicking the ""Automatic Inertia Definition"" button enters the latest value obtained in SCD_Jsum.

# 7.2.1.2 Adaptation to the rigidity of the drive train

The settings for the speed and position control with feed forward control are determined automatically by setting the rigidity. The rigidity is stated in percent in the wizard.

- The setting &lt; 100% reduces the dynamic performance of the controller setting (e.g. for a toothed belt drive).
- The setting &gt; 100% increases the dynamic performance of the controller setting (low play and elasticity).

# CAUTION!

Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# NOTE

This function is not recommended for horizontal axes. Attention must be paid to the mechanical end stops with this function. This function is only to be used with a freely rotating motor shaft.

# NOTE

In systems with high static friction, the inertia determination can be assigned an additional additive speed setpoint. P 404[0] - CON_SCON_AddSRamp can be used for this.

# NOTE

If no values are entered for ""Hysteresis Speed"" and ""Hysteresis Torque"", 20% of the rated speed and 20% of the rated torque is set. The distance covered results from the preset values.

# 7.3.1 Current controller optimization

The torque controller is executed as a PI controller. The gain (P-component) and the integral-action time (I-component) of the individual controllers are programmable. In order to optimize the current control loop, two rectangular reference steps are preset. The object of the optimization is a current controller with moderate dynamism and the following values:

- Current control time: &lt; 1 ms
- Overshoot: &lt; 5%

The faster the actual value approaches the setpoint, the more dynamically the controller is set. The overshoot of the actual value should not be more than 5-10 % of the setpoint (general figure) during the settling process.

- The first step (stage 1, time 1) moves the rotor to a defined position.
- The second step (stage 2, time 2) is used to optimize the torque control (step response). The magnitude of the 2nd step should not be too large, so as to ensure that the voltage setpoint will not go all the way to the limit (low-level signal response required).
- The current and time settings automatically adjust to the motor data. The current is equal to In • .
- ISDSH and ENPO (hardware enable) must be set to ""High"".
- Click ""Start test signal"" button.
- Observe the safety notice: When you confirm the safety notice a step response is executed.
- The oscilloscope is set automatically.

# 7.3.2 Creating the transfer function

The oscilloscope automatically records the amount and phase response of the controller according to the controller settings. This produces an initial estimate of the control quality. To determine the transfer function the noise amplitude (motor rated current) and the sampling time (default 0.125 ms) must be specified. Click the ""Start Test Signal"" button.

# 7.3.3 Decoupling

The current control has a decoupling of the d- and q-axis by means of feed-forward control of the corresponding coupling voltages. The decoupling depends on the stator inductance P 471 MOT_Lsig and can be scaled with parameter P 434.3. This is helpful, for example, if the inductance has been estimated inaccurately. If the decoupling is set too high, current control is unstable.

# 7.3.4 Current actual value filter

A first-order digital filter (PT1) can be configured in order to smooth the measured “isd” and “isq” actual current values. This is particularly useful when using drives with high speeds.

NOTE

l The control dynamic performance will be reduced when using the current actual value filter. Using the current actual value filter is not advisable for drives that require a high control dynamic performance.

The current actual value filter is configured with P 1960[0] - CON_ACT_ISDQ_TF, with the filter time constant being defined in milliseconds. Filtered actual currents “isd” and “isq” can be visualized with scope signals 25 and 26. The unfiltered values can be visualized using scope signals “isd_unfil” (129) and “isq_unfil” (130).

In speed and position-controlled operation, the ripple of the torque and power causes a current ripple in the q-current. When detent torque compensation is used, these q-current input data are imported to a teach table in the controller (teaching routine, learning). The compensation table is created from this (calculation) which is then ultimately used for the feed forward control of the q-current in the controller (compensation).

In the low speed range, these disturbance torques can be eliminated well by the control system. In the medium to high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here. In the high speed range, the disturbance torques can be reduced very well using the table-based compensation described here.

Image 7.9: Typical positioning sequence

speed range, however, this feed forward control with its finite resolution no longer provides an advantage: the detent torque compensation is eliminated linearly via the fade function (ramp).

In a broader sense, detent torque compensation can always be used when a disturbance torque occurs ‘regularly’ as a function of the position.

the teach table (which cannot be saved): the compensation table is filled in immediately and is ready for the compensation. After the ‘calculation' is complete, the parameter P 385[0] automatically jumps back to P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon = READY(0). The teaching and calculation are thus finished. The position source used by the teaching has been stored internally. Now the control system can (should) be stopped. The compensation table still needs to be saved, e.g. using the MDA5 button “Save setting non volatile inside device” (= persistently). The position source used by the teaching is also saved.
