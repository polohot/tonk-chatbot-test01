# 8.3.5.1 Jerk limitation (Profile mode)

The transfer path from the motor to the mechanism may be elastic and so susceptible to oscillation. For that reason, it is advisable to also limit the maximum rate of change of the torque and thus the jerk. Due to the jerk limitation the acceleration and deceleration times rise by the smoothing P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME. The smoothing setting box appears on-screen as soon as the profile type P 2243[0] - MPRO_402_MotionProf type is set to JerkLin(3).

# 8.3.5.1 Jerk limitation (Profile mode)

The transfer path from the motor to the mechanism may be elastic and so susceptible to oscillation. For that reason, it is advisable to also limit the maximum rate of change of the torque and thus the jerk. Due to the jerk limitation the acceleration and deceleration times rise by the smoothing P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME. The smoothing setting box appears on-screen as soon as the profile type P 2243[0] - MPRO_402_MotionProf type is set to JerkLin(3).

# 8.3.5.2 Speed offset (limitation)

With speed override P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR the maximum preset speed reference is scaled in percent.

# 8.3.5.1 Jerk limitation (Profile mode)

The transfer path from the motor to the mechanism may be elastic and so susceptible to oscillation. For that reason, it is advisable to also limit the maximum rate of change of the torque and thus the jerk. Due to the jerk limitation the acceleration and deceleration times rise by the smoothing P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME. The smoothing setting box appears on-screen as soon as the profile type P 2243[0] - MPRO_402_MotionProf type is set to JerkLin(3).

# 8.3.5.1 Jerk limitation (Profile mode)

The transfer path from the motor to the mechanism may be elastic and so susceptible to oscillation. For that reason, it is advisable to also limit the maximum rate of change of the torque and thus the jerk. Due to the jerk limitation the acceleration and deceleration times rise by the smoothing P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME. The smoothing setting box appears on-screen as soon as the profile type P 2243[0] - MPRO_402_MotionProf type is set to JerkLin(3).

# 8.3.5 Jerk limitation and speed offset

# 8.3.4 IP mode with position control

- Position reference values are preset by a higher-level PLC with an appropriate sampling time.
- The sampling time must be balanced between the PLC and controller P 0306 CON_IpRefTS.
- The position references are then transferred to the fine interpolator.
- Pre-control values for speed and acceleration are switched to the control loops.
- For more information on the cycle time see the field bus documentation.

# 8.3.5.1 Jerk limitation (Profile mode)

The transfer path from the motor to the mechanism may be elastic and so susceptible to oscillation. For that reason, it is advisable to also limit the maximum rate of change of the torque and thus the jerk. Due to the jerk limitation the acceleration and deceleration times rise by the smoothing P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME. The smoothing setting box appears on-screen as soon as the profile type P 2243[0] - MPRO_402_MotionProf type is set to JerkLin(3).

# 8.3.5.2 Speed offset (limitation)

With speed override P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR the maximum preset speed reference is scaled in percent.
