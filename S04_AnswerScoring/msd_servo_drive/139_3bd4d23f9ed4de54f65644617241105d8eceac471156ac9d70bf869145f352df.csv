An overcurrent was detected.

- Please check current control settings and step response.
- Check the motor's saturation settings (parameter MOT_LSigDiff). If the error occurred in high-current range, lower saturation values manually.
- If possible, reduce the needed current, especially in low-frequency range.
- If possible, lower the switching frequency or enable automatic frequency selection.
- Check if the encoder offset is set properly.
- Consider using an axis module with higher current rating.

# 11.6.16.11 Error 15-12 (emergency code FF00h)

Cause: Plant inertia / mass is invalid

Suggested steps:

- Please specify motor inertia or try to identify plant inertia
- This issue is probably caused by an unsuitable parameter setting.
- Save your parameter set for a later restore.
