- Please check connected switches for chattering. Consider using the input filter.
- Please check that the encoder offset is set properly.
- If auto commutation is used, re-view the auto commutation setting and test under all possible conditions.
- If torque mode is used, reduce torque, ensure external speed limitation, or increase speed control gain for stronger limitation.
