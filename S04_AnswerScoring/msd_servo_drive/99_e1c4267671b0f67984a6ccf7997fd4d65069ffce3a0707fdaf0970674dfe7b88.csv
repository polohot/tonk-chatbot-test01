- Try to increase the master cycle time.
- Please check the device cabling for proper connection.
- Please check device grounding, i.e. the connection to a metal backplane and cabinet connection to earth.
- Check motor grounding and motor cable length.

This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.
