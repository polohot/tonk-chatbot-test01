If the I2t type is set to ""THERM(1) = Thermal time constant dependent"", all settings apart from the thermal time constant are disabled.

A synchronous motor by design has lower loss than an asynchronous motor, because permanent magnets replace the magnetizing current. ",Why does a synchronous motor have lower loss than an asynchronous motor?,A3,Lower loss in synchronous motors is due to permanent magnets eliminating the need for magnetizing current.,2.046875,2.296875,3.46875,1.2578125,0.259765625
