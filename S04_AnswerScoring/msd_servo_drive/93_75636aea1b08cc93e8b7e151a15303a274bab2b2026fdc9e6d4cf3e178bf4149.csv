11.6.3.9 Error 2-9 (emergency code 6320h)

Cause: Overvoltage in DC link

Suggested steps:

- Please check parameter (749).
- An over-voltage occurred.
- Please check if the actual grid voltage matches the supply setting (parameter PST_VoltageSupply).
- Over-voltage may be caused by a decelerating axis, possibly with high inertia. Reduce deceleration ramp.
- Consider using a braking resistor with higher power. If the supply unit has an internal braking resistor, please contact your service partner.

This is probably a software issue.
