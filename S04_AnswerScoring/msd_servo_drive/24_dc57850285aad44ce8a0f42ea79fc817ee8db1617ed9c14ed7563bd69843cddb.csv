MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

# NOTE

- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

# 6 Encoder

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

# NOTE

- Linear SSI encoders will be treated as rotary SSI encoders. In this case, it is impossible to determine that the system is a linear encoder system based on the encoder head.
- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

# 6 Encoder

# 6.5.6 Encoder gearing

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

# 6 Encoder

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

# 6 Encoder

# 6.5.6 Encoder gearing

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

# 6 Encoder

# 6.5.6 Encoder gearing

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp 72

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

# 6 Encoder

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

# 6 Encoder

# 6.5.6 Encoder gearing

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

# NOTE

- Linear SSI encoders will be treated as rotary SSI encoders. In this case, it is impossible to determine that the system is a linear encoder system based on the encoder head.
- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

# 6 Encoder

# 6.5.6 Encoder gearing

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

# 6.5.6 Encoder gearing

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

# 6 Encoder

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

# 6 Encoder

# 6.5.6 Encoder gearing

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

# NOTE

- Linear SSI encoders will be treated as rotary SSI encoders. In this case, it is impossible to determine that the system is a linear encoder system based on the encoder head.
- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

# 6 Encoder

# 6.5.6 Encoder gearing

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

# 6 Encoder

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

# 6.5.6 Encoder gearing

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

# NOTE

- Linear SSI encoders will be treated as rotary SSI encoders. In this case, it is impossible to determine that the system is a linear encoder system based on the encoder head.
- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

# 6 Encoder

# 6.5.6 Encoder gearing

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- P 543[0] - ENC_CH1_MultiT = Number of multi-turn bits: 0..14 Due to the design of the cyclical SSI interface as a motor feedback interface, the number of multi-turn bits is limited to 14 (no limit to 14 bits in the case of a Sin/Cos interface with SSI one-time reading).
- P 545[0] - ENC_CH1_Code = SSI decoding: BINARY(0) or GRAY(1) Gray decoding will be selected by default. The other option is to use binary decoding.
- P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode = Available SSI auxiliary settings This parameter has a 16-bit hex value. With the default setting (0000h), SSI wire break monitoring will be enabled. A value of 0001h will disable SSI wire break monitoring, meaning that one bit less will be read.

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

NOTE

- Please read the general information on encoder gearing found in Section ""Introduction"" on page 52 beforehand.

Encoder channels Ch1 to Ch3 each feature their own encoder gearing, while encoder channel Ch4 (virtual encoders) does not feature any encoder gearing. In the case of encoder channel Ch2, it is assumed that the resolver will always be used as a commutation encoder on the motor shaft. Because of this, the numerator adjustment range is limited to a value of (+1) or (-1), while the denominator is set at a fixed value of (+1), for the Ch2 encoder gearing ratio. This means that the only option available is to invert the encoder signal (direction reversal).

As a whole, the encoder gearing is a scaling factor in the encoder evaluation system and consists of numerator N (ENC_CHx_Num) for the motor side and denominator D (ENC_CHx_Denom) for the encoder side (output side).

The following are used to configure the encoder gearing...

- Ch1 with P 510[0] - ENC_CH1_Num and P 511[0] - ENC_CH1_Denom,
- Ch2 with P 512[0] - ENC_CH2_Num and P 513[0] - ENC_CH2_Denom,
- Ch3 with P 514[0] - ENC_CH3_Num and P 515[0] - ENC_CH3_Denom.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X7 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 546[0] - ENC_CH1_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH1_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

P 616[0] - ENC_CH1_CycleCount = Sampling cycle in: n x 125 μs (microseconds):

ENC_CH1_CycleCount can be used to slow down the timing for the cyclical SSI encoder evaluation. By default, ENC_CH1_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Monitoring the position difference With SSI encoders, the position difference is monitored automatically. The limit value is based on the maximum speed with reference to one scanning step (125μs). The position difference between two scanning steps is restricted to this limit value. In the event of an EMC disturbance, this limits the (incorrectly detected) tracking error and the response of the controller.

# 6 Encoder

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp 72

# Parameters

l P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and

l P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

# NOTE

l This value at the encoder channel output...

- Already contains the encoder gearing ratio factor (N/D)
- Will be passed into the system in this way (incl. the encoder gearing ratio)
- I.e. is “the value” from the encoder evaluation system

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch2. This channel is used to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”. Encoder channel Ch2 does not feature an absolute value interface. In addition to evaluating resolvers, this channel can also be used to capture “simple” Sin/Cos signals (up to a max. of 1 kHz and with no zero pulse).

Resolvers must always be evaluated using encoder channel Ch2 (P 506 - ENC_CH2_Sel = RES(1)). The resolver pole pairs are set via P 560[0] - ENC_CH2_Lines.

# Resolver basics and requirements

The connected resolver must meet the following criteria:

- Ccw (positive signal progress corresponds to an anticlockwise direction when looking at the shaft from above)
- No transformation phase shift
- Transformation ratio of approx. 0.5

GPOC is a special Moog online process for improving the quality of Sin/Cos signals before they are used to calculate a position. If Sel = RES(1) or Sel = SINCOS (2), this process may come in handy. For details see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74.

- P 561[0] - ENC_CH2_Corr = Signal correction type
The GPOC routine used for track signal correction purposes for sine/cosine signals is used to compensate for systematic errors. The routine is controlled with the Corr and CorrVal parameters (see Section ""Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)"" on page 74).
- P 563[0] - ENC_CH2_EncObsMin = Encoder monitoring minimum, sqrt (a²+b²)
This parameter is used to scale the resolver and Sin/Cos wire break monitoring and represents the “downwards threshold” for an error message. The default setting is 0.2, corresponding to approx.
