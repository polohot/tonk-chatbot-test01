First attempt to use the SFC controller in the proximity of the standstill. (P 792.0 signal = 0). This allows gentle operation and an optimal torque utilization. Set the standstill behaviour with the error voltage model P 1973.1 U_err; generally, a setting of 50% of the original setting yields good results.

It is possible that a flux boost may improve the results at low speeds when a large load is set in motion from a standstill. Set P 792[0] Signal =1, P 792[1] to 50 .
