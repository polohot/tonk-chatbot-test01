Our devices are designed and built with the latest technology and comply with all recognized safety rules and standards. Nevertheless, there are potential hazards that may arise during their use. In this chapter:

- We provide information regarding the residual risks and hazards posed by our devices when they are used as intended.
- We warn you about foreseeable misuse of our devices.
- We point out that it is necessary to exercise due care and caution and go over measures designed to minimize risk.

# 2.2 For your own safety

Our devices may pose certain hazards. Accordingly, you must observe the following safety information and warnings.

NOTE

- The device must only be installed and commissioned in compliance with the documentation for the corresponding device family!

WARNING! Risk of injury posed by uncontrolled rotation!

Improper conduct can lead to serious injury or death.

- Before commissioning motors with feather key on the shaft end it must be secured to prevent it from being ejected, if this is not prevented by drive elements such as pulleys, couplings or similar.

NOTE

- Please also pay special attention to the safety and warning information in the respective valid operation manual when commissioning the drive!
