- Check if the encoder offset is set properly.
- Consider using an axis module with higher current rating.

This is possibly a hardware issue. If other measures fail to solve the problem, please replace the servo drive.

# 11.6.6.5 Error 5-5 (emergency code 2350h)

Cause: (Fast) Overcurrent shut-off ""below 5 Hz""

# Suggested steps:

- Please check torque limits, speed profile and control settings
- An overcurrent was detected. Please check current control settings and step response.
- Check the motor's saturation settings (parameter MOT_LSigDiff). If the error occurred in high-current range, lower saturation values manually.
- If possible, reduce the needed current, especially in low-frequency range.
- If possible, lower the switching frequency or enable automatic frequency selection.
- Check if the encoder offset is set properly.
- Consider using an axis module with higher current rating.

This is possibly a hardware issue. If other measures fail to solve the problem, please replace the servo drive.

This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.

- Please check the device cabling for proper connection.

- An overcurrent was detected.
- Please check current control settings and step response.
- Check the motor's saturation settings (parameter MOT_LSigDiff). If the error occurred in high-current range, lower saturation values manually.
- If possible, reduce the needed current, especially in low-frequency range.
- If possible, lower the switching frequency or enable automatic frequency selection.
- Check if the encoder offset is set properly.
- Consider using an axis module with higher current rating.

This is possibly a hardware issue. If other measures fail to solve the problem, please replace the servo drive.

This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.

- Please check the device cabling for proper connection.
- Please check device grounding, i.e. the connection to a metal backplane and cabinet connection to earth.
- Check motor grounding and motor cable length.

# 11.6.6.4 Error 5-4 (emergency code 2250h)

Cause: Short-circuit test on initialization

# Suggested steps:

- Please check power wiring for short-circuit
- An overcurrent was detected.
- Please check current control settings and step response.
- Check the motor's saturation settings (parameter MOT_LSigDiff). If the error occurred in high-current range, lower saturation values manually.
- If possible, reduce the needed current, especially in low-frequency range.
- If possible, lower the switching frequency or enable automatic frequency selection.
- Check if the encoder offset is set properly.
- Consider using an axis module with higher current rating.

This is possibly a hardware issue. If other measures fail to solve the problem, please replace the servo drive.

This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.

# 11.6.6.3 Error 5-3 (emergency code 2350h)

Cause: Measuring range of AD converter exceeded

# Suggested steps:

- Please check power wiring and control settings
- An overcurrent was detected.
- Please check current control settings and step response.
- Check the motor's saturation settings (parameter MOT_LSigDiff). If the error occurred in high-current range, lower saturation values manually.
- If possible, reduce the needed current, especially in low-frequency range.
- If possible, lower the switching frequency or enable automatic frequency selection.
- Check if the encoder offset is set properly.
- Consider using an axis module with higher current rating.

This is possibly a hardware issue. If other measures fail to solve the problem, please replace the servo drive.

- If possible, lower the switching frequency or enable automatic frequency selection.
- Check if the encoder offset is set properly.
- Consider using an axis module with higher current rating.

This is possibly a hardware issue. If other measures fail to solve the problem, please replace the servo drive.

This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.

- Please check the device cabling for proper connection.
- Please check device grounding, i.e. the connection to a metal backplane and cabinet connection to earth.
- Check motor grounding and motor cable length.

# 11.6.7 Error 6: Motor temperature error

# 11.6.7.1 Error 6-1 (emergency code 4310h)

Cause: Motor temperature above threshold value

# Suggested steps:

- Please let the motor cool down
- Please check motor temperature and motor temperature resistance (PTC sensors do not report the motor temperature). If the values are not plausible, check cables and sensor type.
- If you are not using a system motor, please check with the motor manufacturer if the motor can stand a higher temperature

# 11.6.7.2 Error 6-2 (emergency code 4310h)

Cause: PTC short circuit detected (DIN2)

# Suggested steps:

- Please let the motor cool down
- Please check motor temperature and motor temperature resistance (PTC sensors do not report the motor temperature). If the values are not plausible, check cables and sensor type.
- If you are not using a system motor, please check with the motor manufacturer if the motor can stand a higher temperature

# 11.6.7.3 Error 6-3 (emergency code 4310h)

Cause: PTC/TSS overtemperature, resistance higher than 3500 Ohm

# Suggested steps:

- Please let the motor cool down
- Please check motor temperature and motor temperature resistance (PTC sensors do not report the motor temperature). If the values are not plausible, check cables and sensor type.
- If you are not using a system motor, please check with the motor manufacturer if the motor can stand a higher temperature

# 11.6.7.4 Error 6-4 (emergency code 4310h)

Cause: PTC/TSS error, resistance still higher than 1650 Ohm after overtemperature

# Suggested steps:

- Wait and let motor cool down. Reduce motor load or change motion cycle.
- The motor temperature is too high.
- Please let the motor cool down.
- Please check motor temperature and motor temperature resistance (PTC sensors do not report the motor temperature). If the values are not plausible, check cables and sensor type.
- If you are not using a system motor, please check with the motor manufacturer if the motor can stand a higher temperature.

# 11.6.7.5 Error 6-5 (emergency code 4310h)

Cause: Motor protection method not supported

# Suggested steps:

- Try to use different sensor connection, or contact your service provider.
- This issue is probably caused by an unsuitable parameter setting.
