If there is no need for a pressure limitation, a volumetric flow rate control without pressure limitation (VolCon(5) = volumetric flow rate control (without pressure limitation)) can be selected in P 2860 - HYD_TabConMode. This provides the same functions but is not linked to the pressure control.

An additional pressure limiting control system is set up for this purpose. If the configured pressure limits are reached, the motor speed will be dynamically limited upwards or downwards accordingly.

In addition to the pressure limitation, the minimum and maximum volumetric flow rate can be set via a volumetric flow rate limitation (see Section ""Hydraulic Limitations"" on page 184).

An additional pressure limiting control system is set up for this purpose. If the configured pressure limits are reached, the motor speed will be dynamically limited upwards or downwards accordingly.

In addition to the pressure limitation, the minimum and maximum volumetric flow rate can be set via a volumetric flow rate limitation (see Section ""Hydraulic Limitations"" on page 184).
