known after the first sequence and the direction of movement after the second. This method is suitable for determining the rotor position with braked rotors or motors with a high mass inertia.

- The test signal period (measurement frequency) is defined with P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time. If this value is 0, the controller uses a default test signal frequency of 100 Hz (period 10 ms).
- The test signal’s amplitude (current I0) is defined with P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current. If the value is 0, the amplitude is derived from the motor rated current. If an amplitude greater than the switching frequency-dependent power stage current is specified, the amplitude is limited to half the power stage current.
- The test signal’s DC component (current I1) is defined with P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. If this value is 0, the equal portion is determined from the motor rated current.

NOTE

- A simple parameter setting is obtained by specifying the value 0 for P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time, P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current and P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. The parameters are then assigned default values which are derived from the motor/power stage current. Then the measurement is performed.
- In order to be able to use the complex LHMES auto commutation method to its full extent, you will need to consult with Moog.

# Precondition

The rotor must be securely braked so that it will not be able to move when the rated current is applied. The stator of the machine must be iron-core.

With this method, saturation effects in stator inductance are evaluated. Two test signal sequences are used for this purpose, whereby the position of the rotor axis is

known after the first sequence and the direction of movement after the second. This method is suitable for determining the rotor position with braked rotors or motors with a high mass inertia.

- The test signal period (measurement frequency) is defined with P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time. If this value is 0, the controller uses a default test signal frequency of 100 Hz (period 10 ms).
- The test signal’s amplitude (current I0) is defined with P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current. If the value is 0, the amplitude is derived from the motor rated current. If an amplitude greater than the switching frequency-dependent power stage current is specified, the amplitude is limited to half the power stage current.
- The test signal’s DC component (current I1) is defined with P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. If this value is 0, the equal portion is determined from the motor rated current.

NOTE

- A simple parameter setting is obtained by specifying the value 0 for P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time, P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current and P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. The parameters are then assigned default values which are derived from the motor/power stage current. Then the measurement is performed.
- In order to be able to use the complex LHMES auto commutation method to its full extent, you will need to consult with Moog.

# Precondition

The rotor must be securely braked so that it will not be able to move when the rated current is applied. The stator of the machine must be iron-core.

# 7.8.2 LHMES(2) method

known after the first sequence and the direction of movement after the second. This method is suitable for determining the rotor position with braked rotors or motors with a high mass inertia.

- The test signal period (measurement frequency) is defined with P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time. If this value is 0, the controller uses a default test signal frequency of 100 Hz (period 10 ms).
- The test signal’s amplitude (current I0) is defined with P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current. If the value is 0, the amplitude is derived from the motor rated current. If an amplitude greater than the switching frequency-dependent power stage current is specified, the amplitude is limited to half the power stage current.
- The test signal’s DC component (current I1) is defined with P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. If this value is 0, the equal portion is determined from the motor rated current.

NOTE

- A simple parameter setting is obtained by specifying the value 0 for P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time, P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current and P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. The parameters are then assigned default values which are derived from the motor/power stage current. Then the measurement is performed.
- In order to be able to use the complex LHMES auto commutation method to its full extent, you will need to consult with Moog.

# Precondition

The rotor must be securely braked so that it will not be able to move when the rated current is applied. The stator of the machine must be iron-core.

With this method, saturation effects in stator inductance are evaluated. Two test signal sequences are used for this purpose, whereby the position of the rotor axis is

known after the first sequence and the direction of movement after the second. This method is suitable for determining the rotor position with braked rotors or motors with a high mass inertia.

- The test signal period (measurement frequency) is defined with P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time. If this value is 0, the controller uses a default test signal frequency of 100 Hz (period 10 ms).
- The test signal’s amplitude (current I0) is defined with P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current. If the value is 0, the amplitude is derived from the motor rated current. If an amplitude greater than the switching frequency-dependent power stage current is specified, the amplitude is limited to half the power stage current.
- The test signal’s DC component (current I1) is defined with P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. If this value is 0, the equal portion is determined from the motor rated current.

NOTE

- A simple parameter setting is obtained by specifying the value 0 for P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time, P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current and P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. The parameters are then assigned default values which are derived from the motor/power stage current. Then the measurement is performed.
- In order to be able to use the complex LHMES auto commutation method to its full extent, you will need to consult with Moog.

# Precondition

The rotor must be securely braked so that it will not be able to move when the rated current is applied. The stator of the machine must be iron-core.

With this method, saturation effects in stator inductance are evaluated. Two test signal sequences are used for this purpose, whereby the position of the rotor axis is

- The test signal’s amplitude (current I0) is defined with P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current. If the value is 0, the amplitude is derived from the motor rated current. If an amplitude greater than the switching frequency-dependent power stage current is specified, the amplitude is limited to half the power stage current.
- The test signal’s DC component (current I1) is defined with P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. If this value is 0, the equal portion is determined from the motor rated current.

NOTE

- A simple parameter setting is obtained by specifying the value 0 for P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time, P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current and P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. The parameters are then assigned default values which are derived from the motor/power stage current. Then the measurement is performed.
- In order to be able to use the complex LHMES auto commutation method to its full extent, you will need to consult with Moog.

# NOTE

- Inexperienced users should always choose the rated motor current (amplitude) as the current and a time of at least 2000 ms.
- If the axis is blocked, meaning the rotor is unable to align itself, the method will not work correctly. As a result, the commutation angle will be incorrectly defined and the motor may perform uncontrolled movements.
- When calculating the data sets of linear motors the values for time and current adjust automatically.

known after the first sequence and the direction of movement after the second. This method is suitable for determining the rotor position with braked rotors or motors with a high mass inertia.

- The test signal period (measurement frequency) is defined with P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time. If this value is 0, the controller uses a default test signal frequency of 100 Hz (period 10 ms).
- The test signal’s amplitude (current I0) is defined with P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current. If the value is 0, the amplitude is derived from the motor rated current. If an amplitude greater than the switching frequency-dependent power stage current is specified, the amplitude is limited to half the power stage current.
- The test signal’s DC component (current I1) is defined with P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. If this value is 0, the equal portion is determined from the motor rated current.

NOTE

- A simple parameter setting is obtained by specifying the value 0 for P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time, P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current and P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. The parameters are then assigned default values which are derived from the motor/power stage current. Then the measurement is performed.
- In order to be able to use the complex LHMES auto commutation method to its full extent, you will need to consult with Moog.

# Precondition

The rotor must be securely braked so that it will not be able to move when the rated current is applied. The stator of the machine must be iron-core.

With this method, saturation effects in stator inductance are evaluated. Two test signal sequences are used for this purpose, whereby the position of the rotor axis is

- Inexperienced users should always choose the rated motor current (amplitude) as the current and a time of at least 2000 ms.
- If the axis is blocked, meaning the rotor is unable to align itself, the method will not work correctly. As a result, the commutation angle will be incorrectly defined and the motor may perform uncontrolled movements.
- When calculating the data sets of linear motors the values for time and current adjust automatically.

# 7.8.2 LHMES(2) method

known after the first sequence and the direction of movement after the second. This method is suitable for determining the rotor position with braked rotors or motors with a high mass inertia.

- The test signal period (measurement frequency) is defined with P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time. If this value is 0, the controller uses a default test signal frequency of 100 Hz (period 10 ms).
- The test signal’s amplitude (current I0) is defined with P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current. If the value is 0, the amplitude is derived from the motor rated current. If an amplitude greater than the switching frequency-dependent power stage current is specified, the amplitude is limited to half the power stage current.
- The test signal’s DC component (current I1) is defined with P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. If this value is 0, the equal portion is determined from the motor rated current.

NOTE

- A simple parameter setting is obtained by specifying the value 0 for P 392[2] - CON_ICOM_Time, P 393[0] - CON_ICOM_Current and P 393[1] - CON_ICOM_Current. The parameters are then assigned default values which are derived from the motor/power stage current. Then the measurement is performed.
- In order to be able to use the complex LHMES auto commutation method to its full extent, you will need to consult with Moog.

# Precondition

The rotor must be securely braked so that it will not be able to move when the rated current is applied. The stator of the machine must be iron-core.

With this method, saturation effects in stator inductance are evaluated. Two test signal sequences are used for this purpose, whereby the position of the rotor axis is
