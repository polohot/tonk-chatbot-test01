The speed control might run away, most likely due to a wrong encoder offset.

- Please check that the encoder offset is set properly.
- If auto commutation is used, re-view the auto commutation setting and test under all possible conditions.
- If torque mode is used, reduce torque, ensure external speed limitation, or increase speed control gain for stronger limitation.

This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.

- Please check the device cabling for proper connection.
- Please check device grounding, i.e. the connection to a metal backplane and cabinet connection to earth.
- Check motor grounding and motor cable length.
