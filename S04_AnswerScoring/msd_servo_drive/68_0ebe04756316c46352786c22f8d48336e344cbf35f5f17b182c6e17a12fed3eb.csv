# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

NOTE

- The reference filters are initialized only after the control has been re-enabled or by a device restart.
- Select reference source
- Motion profile adaptation: scaling, ramps and smoothing time.
- In reference processing by way of the profile generator the fine interpolator is always in use.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

- Select jerk conditions

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

All torque/force data is given in [%] with one decimal place.

# Torque polarity

The polarity of the torque can be inverted according to the application. A positive torque reference indicates clockwise rotation (looking at the motor shaft).

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

NOTE

- The reference filters are initialized only after the control has been re-enabled or by a device restart.
- Select reference source
- Motion profile adaptation: scaling, ramps and smoothing time.
- In reference processing by way of the profile generator the fine interpolator is always in use.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

- Select jerk conditions

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

- Select jerk conditions

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

# Torque polarity

The polarity of the torque can be inverted according to the application. A positive torque reference indicates clockwise rotation (looking at the motor shaft).

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task.

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°

NOTE

- The reference filters are initialized only after the control has been re-enabled or by a device restart.
- Select reference source
- Motion profile adaptation: scaling, ramps and smoothing time.
- In reference processing by way of the profile generator the fine interpolator is always in use.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

",What distinguishes linear weighting from rotary weighting in the SERCOS profile according to the 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp' document?,A2,The document highlights that linear and rotary weighting use different units and scaling to accommodate their respective motion types.,1.46875,1.515625,3.46875,1.25,0.3203125

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

All torque/force data is given in [%] with one decimal place.

# Torque polarity

The polarity of the torque can be inverted according to the application. A positive torque reference indicates clockwise rotation (looking at the motor shaft).

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

",What distinguishes linear weighting from rotary weighting in the SERCOS profile according to the 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp' document?,A5,The 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp' delineates between linear and rotary weighting by their application to either translational or rotational parameters.,1.6015625,1.625,3.609375,1.3046875,0.23828125

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task.

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°

NOTE

- The reference filters are initialized only after the control has been re-enabled or by a device restart.
- Select reference source
- Motion profile adaptation: scaling, ramps and smoothing time.
- In reference processing by way of the profile generator the fine interpolator is always in use.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

",What happens to the actual position when it reaches 0° in the negative direction according to the 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp' document?,A3,"In the 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp', it's explained that a negative direction movement to 0° results in the position being adjusted to 360°.",2.25,2.234375,3.546875,1.5078125,0.734375

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

A distinction must be made between linear and rotary weighting here. In percentage weighting the permanently permissible standstill torque of the motor is used as the reference value. All torque/force data is given in [%] with one decimal place.

# Torque polarity

The polarity of the torque can be inverted according to the application. A positive torque reference indicates clockwise rotation (looking at the motor shaft).

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

NOTE

- The reference filters are initialized only after the control has been re-enabled or by a device restart.
- Select reference source
- Motion profile adaptation: scaling, ramps and smoothing time.
- In reference processing by way of the profile generator the fine interpolator is always in use.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

",What is the effect of the 'infinite motion task' when using the indexing table function as described in the 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp' document?,A5,"The 'MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp' specifies that infinite motion tasks override normal targeting, focusing instead on sustained speed until a new command is received.",3.015625,3.078125,3.796875,1.59375,0.55078125

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

NOTE

- The reference filters are initialized only after the control has been re-enabled or by a device restart.
- Select reference source
- Motion profile adaptation: scaling, ramps and smoothing time.
- In reference processing by way of the profile generator the fine interpolator is always in use.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# Profile Generator with speed control:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control
- Under Profile select the profile generator (PG) P 301[0] - CON_Ref_Mode = PG(0)
- Selection of reference source/>P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL
- Scaling
- Select jerk conditions
- Set stop ramps, smoothing, filter, homing

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

# 8.2.1.3 Process option “Path - optimized”

Not path-optimized Optimized path

An absolute target position is always approached by the shortest path. Relative movements cannot be carried out with the “path – optimized” mode.

|Position range|Example|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Target position < 120°< 360°|The drive moves to the target position|within 360°.|
|Target position = 120° = 120°|The drive remains in position.| |
|Target position > 600° - 360° =|The drive moves to the position within|240° (target position - (n x circumferential length))|

Table 8.3: Path-optimized movement

Table 8.4: Path optimization diagram

# 8.2.1.4 Infinite motion task when using indexing table function

In the case of infinite motion tasks the drive moves at constant speed, regardless of a transmitted target position, until the mode is deactivated or is overwritten by a new motion task. On switching to the next driving set (absolute or relative), the new target position is approached in the current direction of movement. A preset path optimization is ignored when the indexing table is active.

# 8.2.1.5 Relative motion task when using indexing table function

Relative driving jobs may relate to the current target position or to the actual position. For more information see ""Field Buses"" User Manuals. In the case of relative driving jobs greater travel distances than the circumferential length are possible.

Example without gear ratio:

- Circumferential length = 360°
- Relative target position = 800°
- Start position = 0°
- Movement: The drive will complete two motor revolutions (720°) and stop at the 3rd revolution at 80° (800° - 720°).

# 8.2.2 SERCOS

When using the SERCOS profile, scaling of the units is termed weighting. The weighting describes the physical unit and the exponent with which the numerical values of the parameters exchanged between the master control system and the drives are to be interpreted. The method of weighting is defined by the parameters for position, speed, force/torque and acceleration weighting.

- Select jerk conditions

# 8.3.2 PG mode with position control

Travel commands are transmitted to the internal profile generator (see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 241). It is composed of the following items:

- Target position
- Maximum travel speed
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum deceleration

The profile generator uses the P 166[0] - MPRO_REF_JTIME jerk values and a P 167[0] - MPRO_REF_OVR override factor for the travel speed in order to generate the trajectory for the position setpoint that will take the least amount of time, taking all limitations into account.

The position references are then processed with the selected interpolation method.

# 8 Motion profile

# 8.3.2.1 Motion profile / Basic settings

The position references are used to generate pre-control values for speed Interpolation (IP) mode and acceleration. These are scanned at the sampling time of the position controller (normally 125 μs) and switched to the control loops.

Reference values are interpolated in linear mode before being switched to the control loops.

- The profile generator is inactive.
- Ramps and smoothing are inactive.
- The reference values are switched directly to the closed-loop control.

CAUTION! Your system/motor may be damaged if put into operation in an uncontrolled or inappropriate manner. Improper conduct can cause damage to your system/machine.

Before the “Start” step, make absolutely sure that a valid setpoint has been entered, as the configured setpoint will be immediately transmitted to the motor after the motor control function starts, which may result in the motor accelerating unexpectedly.

# Speed control in IP mode:

- Control mode P 300[0] - CON_CfgCon = speed control or setting via Modes of Operation (CAN, EtherCAT®)
- Selection of reference source P 165[0] - MPRO_REF_SEL

Image 8.27: PG mode with position control

# 8.3.3 IP mode with speed control

In IP (Interpolation) mode the appropriate reference source and correct scaling of units are selected for the speed reference before the reference is passed via the interpolator to the control. Linear interpolation is always applied in this process.
