Cause:  Error while init current monitoring

# Suggested steps:

- Check the device setting! (If possible, try a different switching frequency.)
- This issue is probably caused by an unsuitable parameter setting.
- Save your parameter set for a later restore.
- See 'history of parameter changes' and undo the latest changes.
- Please check your parameter set for implausible settings.
- Please set device to factory setting, restart, and see if the error occurs again.
- When reporting this error to your service partner, please include your device's parameter setting.
