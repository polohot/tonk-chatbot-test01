SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit
- POdd = Odd parity bit
- PEven = Even parity bit
- Free = A free bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796).

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit
- POdd = Odd parity bit
- PEven = Even parity bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- Data = Sequence of all data bits

- Nothing = No bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

P 792[1] - Frequency and P 792[2] - d-Amplitude sinus will be used as the measuring frequency and measuring amplitude. In addition, P 794[0] - SettlingTime, P 794[1] - ICOM_current and P 794[2] - ICOM_time need to be configured.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit
- POdd = Odd parity bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit
- POdd = Odd parity bit

Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit
- POdd = Odd parity bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- Data = Sequence of all data bits

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit
- POdd = Odd parity bit
- PEven = Even parity bit
- Free = A free bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs.

At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit
- POdd = Odd parity bit
- PEven = Even parity bit
- Free = A free bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit
- POdd = Odd parity bit
- PEven = Even parity bit
- Free = A free bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

P 792[1] - Frequency and P 792[2] - d-Amplitude sinus will be used as the measuring frequency and measuring amplitude. In addition, P 794[0] - SettlingTime, P 794[1] - ICOM_current and P 794[2] - ICOM_time need to be configured.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit
- POdd = Odd parity bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

# MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.

P 792[1] - Frequency and P 792[2] - d-Amplitude sinus will be used as the measuring frequency and measuring amplitude. In addition, P 794[0] - SettlingTime, P 794[1] - ICOM_current and P 794[2] - ICOM_time need to be configured.

# 6.8.1.2 Test signal generator

The test signal generator is required in order to ensure that the Kalman filter will be able to estimate position and speed information even at low speeds (all the way to a stop). There are various signals available for this purpose.

The forms available are a sinusoidal signal and a 32-bit PRBS signal. The frequencies can be freely selected within a range of 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. In addition, there is the option of subjecting the d or q axis to the signals either individually (in an additive manner) or in combination (in a multiplicative manner).

P 792[0] - Signal: 0 = No measuring signal; 1 = Addition; 2 = Multiplication

When using the additive solution, each signal will have its own amplitude. In contrast, when using the combination solution, only the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal will be used.

In addition, scaling for the test signal amplitudes has been implemented. This ensures that the signal can be applied gradually over a specified speed range. The following is recommended as a good test signal: A sinusoidal signal with a current amplitude of approx. 10% of the rated current on the d axis with a frequency of approx. 400 Hz. (P 792[0] = 1; P 792[1] = 400; P 792[2] = 10% Irated) can be defined as necessary.

In the case of problematic motors, it can be useful to inject an additive d current. This current can be configured to be dependent on the speed (P 792[9] - d current offset) or load (796). The following two diagrams use examples to illustrate the influence that the ramp parameters have on the additive d components. Please note, however, that this current will also increase motor losses, meaning it should only be used in exceptional cases.

SSI wire break monitoring (bit monitoring during monoflop time) The Sel, Lines, MultiT and SingleT parameters are self-explanatory. If monitoring is enabled, the controller, as the SSI clock master, will read data for one more clock cycle after the data bits (reading data after the data bits end is permissible). The bit that the master reads in addition to the data bits this way comes from the SSI encoder’s monoflop time. At the time corresponding to this bit, the SSI encoder must drive the data lines with a logic 0. If the data lines on connector X8 are open, a logic 1 will be read here. The bit monitoring at this point makes it possible to determine whether the SSI data lines are being actively driven with a logic 0 at this point (no “wire break”) or are not (“wire break”). SSI wire break monitoring can be disabled by setting P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode to 0001h.

# Mode parameters and CycleCount parameters

P 576[0] - ENC_CH3_Mode can be used to run a parity evaluation after the data. In addition, ENC_CH3_Mode makes it possible to run special SSI encoders that deliver one or more special bits after the data. In this case, the MSD Servo Drive will not evaluate these bits – this mode is meant to make it possible to work with SSI encoders that require for these bits to be sampled. P 636[0] - ENC_CH3_CycleCount makes it possible to run slower SSI encoders that cannot handle the required cycle of 125 μs. The control characteristics will deteriorate when using this type of SSI encoder, which is why doing so is not recommended.

Following is a list of what some of the terms in the table below stand for:

- Data = Sequence of all data bits
- EncObs = Wire break bit
- Nothing = No bit
- POdd = Odd parity bit
- PEven = Even parity bit
- Free = A free bit

By default, ENC_CH3_CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and must only be used when necessary.

Parameters

6.8 Channel 4: Virtual encoder

- P 500[0] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[0].SingleTurn and
- P 500[1] - ENC_CH1_ActVal[1].MultiTurn

are used, for example, to indicate the current position value at the output for encoder channel Ch1. These parameters can also be used for checking purposes during commissioning.

NOTE

- This value at the encoder channel output...

The encoder gearing ratio has a multiplicative effect on the position progress, i.e. either “expanding” or “compressing”.

A distinction can be drawn between an encoder’s motor mode and field mode:

- Motor mode: The encoder is the motor commutation encoder
- Field encoder: The encoder is not the motor commutation encoder (instead, it is an additional encoder in the “field”, e.g. used for position control purposes)

In motor mode, the encoder gearing is used exclusively to synchronize the motor shaft with the encoder shaft (default: 1:1 if the shaft is the same). In this case, a position progress value will be passed to the system at the encoder channel output. This value will be proportional to the position progress of the motor’s commutation (adjusted for the pole pair number).

In field mode, the encoder gearing can be used “freely” for scaling purposes.
