# 4.2 Power failure bridging

# 4.2.1 Functional description

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2 Power failure bridging

# 4.2.1 Functional description

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2.1 Functional description

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2 Power failure bridging

# 4.2.1 Functional description

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2 Power failure bridging

# 4.2.1 Functional description

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2 Power failure bridging

# 4.2.1 Functional description

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2 Power failure bridging

# 4.2.1 Functional description

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2.1 Functional description

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2 Power failure bridging

# 4.2.1 Functional description

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2.1 Functional description

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

# 4.2 Power failure bridging

# 4.2.1 Functional description

# 4.2.1.1 Detection of a voltage failure

The P 2940 - CON_PowerFail_Sel selection parameter can be used to select the following operating modes:

|0= (OFF)|switched off|
|---|---|
|1= (Ret)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.|
|2= (NoRet)|Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.|
|3= (NoLim)|Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.|
|5= (RetAbs)|Same as 1=Ret, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|6= (NotRetAbs)|Same as 2=NoRet, but with absolute voltage levels and without validation check.|
|7= (NoRetAbsPulse)|Same as 6=NoRetAbs, but with pulse operation.|

In the event of a power failure, the DC link voltage can be supported by using the motor’s rotational energy. To this end, the motor will be operated as a generator and decelerated in a controlled manner in the event of a power failure so that a configurable DC link voltage setpoint will be maintained. This function is especially useful when it comes to powering the electronics in drives with magnetic bearings, as this will prevent the assembly from crashing into the safety bearing in the event of a power failure all the way to the lowest possible speeds.

NOTE

Please note that the components which need bridging must be powered via the DC link (DC power supply). In particular, the power supply of the servo drive itself (24 V control voltage) must be ensured.

# 4.2.1.2 Parametrisation

P 2941 - CON_POWF_VCtrl is used to configure the voltage controller by adjusting the corresponding gain and reset time. Within this context, the specified gain refers to the motor’s rated speed. At lower speeds, the gain will be automatically increased in order to maintain a constant dynamic performance in the voltage control circuit.

P 2942 - CON_POWF_VLim is used to configure the threshold voltage for detecting power failures / power returns, as well as the voltage setpoint for the controller. The configured voltage values will not be absolute values, but will instead be added to specific DC link threshold values (based on the operating mode). The corresponding

Image 4.2: Power failure bridging settings screen

# 4.2.1.3 Modes

# Mode 1

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will start up again if the power returns within a configurable period of time.

The power failure detection limit is formed by adding together P 701[12] - u_zkoff (Software shut-off limit for detection of DC link undervoltage) and P 2942[0] - POWF_Von. It should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 40 V).

Likewise, the voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[12] - u_zkoff and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. The voltage setpoint must be lower than the detection limit so that it will be possible to detect when the power returns. Moreover, it should be considerably higher than the shutdown limit (default setting = 20 V).

After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.

If a power return is detected within the time period set in P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime, the drive will return to its original control state. If power returns after the aforementioned time period has already elapsed, error 34-1 will be triggered. If P 2943[0] - CON_POWF_RetTime is set to 65535, there will be no time limit for the drive to return to its original control state after power returns.

# Mode 2

Power failure bridging with power return detection. The system will not start up again.

Same as mode 1, except the system will not start up again if the power returns. Error 34-1 will always be triggered once the power returns.

# Mode 3

Fastest possible speed reduction without power return detection.

In terms of configuring the power failure detection limits, the requirements listed for mode 1 apply here as well. The voltage setpoint is yielded by adding P 701[17] - u_bc_on (braking chopper threshold) and P 2942[1] - POWF_VRef. After a power failure is detected, the controller will control the voltage so that it reaches the configured setpoint. This setpoint will be considerably higher than the power failure detection limit, which will technically ensure that it will not be possible to detect the return of power. This mode is characterized by the fact that the DC link voltage is typically raised all the way over the braking chopper threshold, resulting in the braking energy being converted into braking resistance. Accordingly, the drive will decelerate as quickly as possible.

# Mode 4

Only with expanded VFC functionality.

# 4 Power stage

If the power does not return, the drive will theoretically decelerate all the way to a stop. Within this context, there will be a specific speed below which it will not be possible to maintain the DC link voltage any longer even with the maximum motor (brake) current. This will result in an undervoltage shutdown.
