# 11.6.42.3     Error 45-2 (emergency code FF00h)

Cause:

Movement requested which was limited by reversing lock, limit switch or reference value limitation. Lock active in both directions.

# Suggested steps:

- Check plausibility of limit switches and/or software limits
- The reference value violates a lock or limit switch. Please check reference values. If this axis is working in cyclic synchronous mode, make a scope record.
- Check factor group settings.
