In the event of a single-phase failure of the device supply, e.g. a burned-out non-renewable fuse, the DC link voltage is maintained and the device continues to operate for the time being. However, the input rectifier can be damaged at a high output power.

The single-phase power failure detection is set with P 737[0] MON_MNCTL - bit 3 = 1.

In the event of a single-phase failure of the device supply, e.g. a burned-out non-renewable fuse, the DC link voltage is maintained and the device continues to operate for the time being. However, the input rectifier can be damaged at a high output power.

The single-phase power failure detection is set with P 737[0] MON_MNCTL - bit 3 = 1.

The quadratic ripple (variance) of the DC link voltage is calculated. If it exceeds the threshold value P 760[2]-MON_VDC_Guard - MaxVar for the time P 760[3]-MON_VDC_Guard - Max_time, the monitoring is triggered.

The actual value is shown in P 701[28] - VDC Variance. Measure this value at maximum output power and proper operation, then use about 5-10 times that as the monitoring threshold.

The monitoring triggers error 54-1 (Emergency code 6100h). See chapter 11.6 Error list.

Table 4.8: Parameter - Single-phase failure of the device power supply

In the event of a single-phase failure of the device supply, e.g. a burned-out non-renewable fuse, the DC link voltage is maintained and the device continues to operate for the time being. However, the input rectifier can be damaged at a high output power.

The single-phase power failure detection is set with P 737[0] MON_MNCTL - bit 3 = 1.

The quadratic ripple (variance) of the DC link voltage is calculated. If it exceeds the threshold value P 760[2]-MON_VDC_Guard - MaxVar for the time P 760[3]-MON_VDC_Guard - Max_time, the monitoring is triggered.

The actual value is shown in P 701[28] - VDC Variance. Measure this value at maximum output power and proper operation, then use about 5-10 times that as the monitoring threshold.

The monitoring triggers error 54-1 (Emergency code 6100h). See chapter 11.6 Error list.
