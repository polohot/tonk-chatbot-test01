# 7.3.6.2 Current observer

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

Image 7.19: Extended pre-control structure shows the extended pre-control structure. This is activated with P 1976 = ON. This delays the current setpoint by one controller cycle; this is not suitable for high-performance speed control.

The feed forward control of the voltage drop across the stator resistance of the machine depends on P 470 MOT_Rstat. The feed forward control of the fault voltage of the power stage depends on P 302 CON_SwitchFreq. Both can be subjected to feed forward control and scaled with P 434.4.

The voltage to change the current over the stator inductance depends on P 471 MOT_Lsig. The feed forward control can be scaled with P 434.5.

P 434.6 enables filtering of the voltage thus set, which reduces noise. Do not set this filter too high, otherwise there will no longer be an increase in bandwidth.

The controller gain is determined by activating test signals (Autotuning). The calculations and the relevant autotuning are carried out in the servo drive. The advanced settings are made in P 1530[0] - SCD_SetMotorControl, P 1531[0] - SCD_Action_Sel and P 1533[0] - SCD_AT_Bandwidth.

- The 3dB bandwidth of the closed loop is specified as the bandwidth.
- Advisable bandwidth settings at 8 kHz switching frequency are up to approximately 2000 Hz; at 16 kHz switching frequency up to approximately 3000 Hz.

The voltage to change the current over the stator inductance depends on P 471 MOT_Lsig. The feed forward control can be scaled with P 434.5.

P 434.6 enables filtering of the voltage thus set, which reduces noise. Do not set this filter too high, otherwise there will no longer be an increase in bandwidth.

# 7.3.6.2 Current observer

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

Image 7.19: Extended pre-control structure shows the extended pre-control structure. This is activated with P 1976 = ON. This delays the current setpoint by one controller cycle; this is not suitable for high-performance speed control.

The feed forward control of the voltage drop across the stator resistance of the machine depends on P 470 MOT_Rstat. The feed forward control of the fault voltage of the power stage depends on P 302 CON_SwitchFreq. Both can be subjected to feed forward control and scaled with P 434.4.

The voltage to change the current over the stator inductance depends on P 471 MOT_Lsig. The feed forward control can be scaled with P 434.5.

P 434.6 enables filtering of the voltage thus set, which reduces noise. Do not set this filter too high, otherwise there will no longer be an increase in bandwidth.

# 7.3.6.2 Current observer

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

Image 7.19: Extended pre-control structure shows the extended pre-control structure. This is activated with P 1976 = ON. This delays the current setpoint by one controller cycle; this is not suitable for high-performance speed control.

The feed forward control of the voltage drop across the stator resistance of the machine depends on P 470 MOT_Rstat. The feed forward control of the fault voltage of the power stage depends on P 302 CON_SwitchFreq. Both can be subjected to feed forward control and scaled with P 434.4.

The voltage to change the current over the stator inductance depends on P 471 MOT_Lsig. The feed forward control can be scaled with P 434.5.

P 434.6 enables filtering of the voltage thus set, which reduces noise. Do not set this filter too high, otherwise there will no longer be an increase in bandwidth.

# 7.3.6.2 Current observer

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

Image 7.19: Extended pre-control structure shows the extended pre-control structure. This is activated with P 1976 = ON. This delays the current setpoint by one controller cycle; this is not suitable for high-performance speed control.

The feed forward control of the voltage drop across the stator resistance of the machine depends on P 470 MOT_Rstat. The feed forward control of the fault voltage of the power stage depends on P 302 CON_SwitchFreq. Both can be subjected to feed forward control and scaled with P 434.4.

The voltage to change the current over the stator inductance depends on P 471 MOT_Lsig. The feed forward control can be scaled with P 434.5.

P 434.6 enables filtering of the voltage thus set, which reduces noise. Do not set this filter too high, otherwise there will no longer be an increase in bandwidth.

# 7.3.6.2 Current observer

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

Image 7.19: Extended pre-control structure shows the extended pre-control structure. This is activated with P 1976 = ON. This delays the current setpoint by one controller cycle; this is not suitable for high-performance speed control.

The feed forward control of the voltage drop across the stator resistance of the machine depends on P 470 MOT_Rstat. The feed forward control of the fault voltage of the power stage depends on P 302 CON_SwitchFreq. Both can be subjected to feed forward control and scaled with P 434.4.

The voltage to change the current over the stator inductance depends on P 471 MOT_Lsig. The feed forward control can be scaled with P 434.5.

P 434.6 enables filtering of the voltage thus set, which reduces noise. Do not set this filter too high, otherwise there will no longer be an increase in bandwidth.

# 7.3.6.2 Current observer

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

Image 7.19: Extended pre-control structure shows the extended pre-control structure. This is activated with P 1976 = ON. This delays the current setpoint by one controller cycle; this is not suitable for high-performance speed control.

The feed forward control of the voltage drop across the stator resistance of the machine depends on P 470 MOT_Rstat. The feed forward control of the fault voltage of the power stage depends on P 302 CON_SwitchFreq. Both can be subjected to feed forward control and scaled with P 434.4.

The voltage to change the current over the stator inductance depends on P 471 MOT_Lsig. The feed forward control can be scaled with P 434.5.

P 434.6 enables filtering of the voltage thus set, which reduces noise. Do not set this filter too high, otherwise there will no longer be an increase in bandwidth.

# 7.3.6.2 Current observer

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

Image 7.19: Extended pre-control structure shows the extended pre-control structure. This is activated with P 1976 = ON. This delays the current setpoint by one controller cycle; this is not suitable for high-performance speed control.

The feed forward control of the voltage drop across the stator resistance of the machine depends on P 470 MOT_Rstat. The feed forward control of the fault voltage of the power stage depends on P 302 CON_SwitchFreq. Both can be subjected to feed forward control and scaled with P 434.4.

The voltage to change the current over the stator inductance depends on P 471 MOT_Lsig. The feed forward control can be scaled with P 434.5.

P 434.6 enables filtering of the voltage thus set, which reduces noise. Do not set this filter too high, otherwise there will no longer be an increase in bandwidth.

The controller gain is determined by activating test signals (Autotuning). The calculations and the relevant autotuning are carried out in the servo drive. The advanced settings are made in P 1530[0] - SCD_SetMotorControl, P 1531[0] - SCD_Action_Sel and P 1533[0] - SCD_AT_Bandwidth.

- The 3dB bandwidth of the closed loop is specified as the bandwidth.
- Advisable bandwidth settings at 8 kHz switching frequency are up to approximately 2000 Hz; at 16 kHz switching frequency up to approximately 3000 Hz.

# 7.3.6.2 Current observer

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

Image 7.19: Extended pre-control structure shows the extended pre-control structure. This is activated with P 1976 = ON. This delays the current setpoint by one controller cycle; this is not suitable for high-performance speed control.

The feed forward control of the voltage drop across the stator resistance of the machine depends on P 470 MOT_Rstat. The feed forward control of the fault voltage of the power stage depends on P 302 CON_SwitchFreq. Both can be subjected to feed forward control and scaled with P 434.4.

The voltage to change the current over the stator inductance depends on P 471 MOT_Lsig. The feed forward control can be scaled with P 434.5.

P 434.6 enables filtering of the voltage thus set, which reduces noise. Do not set this filter too high, otherwise there will no longer be an increase in bandwidth.

The controller gain is determined by activating test signals (Autotuning). The calculations and the relevant autotuning are carried out in the servo drive. The advanced settings are made in P 1530[0] - SCD_SetMotorControl, P 1531[0] - SCD_Action_Sel and P 1533[0] - SCD_AT_Bandwidth.

- The 3dB bandwidth of the closed loop is specified as the bandwidth.
- Advisable bandwidth settings at 8 kHz switching frequency are up to approximately 2000 Hz; at 16 kHz switching frequency up to approximately 3000 Hz.
- The P-gain CCON_Kp is calculated according to the amount optimum.

# 7.3.6.2 Current observer

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

Image 7.19: Extended pre-control structure shows the extended pre-control structure. This is activated with P 1976 = ON. This delays the current setpoint by one controller cycle; this is not suitable for high-performance speed control.

The feed forward control of the voltage drop across the stator resistance of the machine depends on P 470 MOT_Rstat. The feed forward control of the fault voltage of the power stage depends on P 302 CON_SwitchFreq. Both can be subjected to feed forward control and scaled with P 434.4.

The voltage to change the current over the stator inductance depends on P 471 MOT_Lsig. The feed forward control can be scaled with P 434.5.

P 434.6 enables filtering of the voltage thus set, which reduces noise. Do not set this filter too high, otherwise there will no longer be an increase in bandwidth.

# 7.3.6.2 Current observer

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

The feed forward control of the voltage drop across the stator resistance of the machine depends on P 470 MOT_Rstat. The feed forward control of the fault voltage of the power stage depends on P 302 CON_SwitchFreq. Both can be subjected to feed forward control and scaled with P 434.4.

The voltage to change the current over the stator inductance depends on P 471 MOT_Lsig. The feed forward control can be scaled with P 434.5.

The feed forward control of the voltage drop across the stator resistance of the machine depends on P 470 MOT_Rstat. The feed forward control of the fault voltage of the power stage depends on P 302 CON_SwitchFreq. Both can be subjected to feed forward control and scaled with P 434.4.

The voltage to change the current over the stator inductance depends on P 471 MOT_Lsig. The feed forward control can be scaled with P 434.5.

P 434.6 enables filtering of the voltage thus set, which reduces noise. Do not set this filter too high, otherwise there will no longer be an increase in bandwidth.

# 7.3.6.2 Current observer

In the current control circuit, the calculation of voltage setpoints and PWM runtime appears as dead time. This is the main factor determining the possible performance of current control. The current observer eliminates this dead time to the greatest possible extent by predicting current by means of a scanning step. In addition, many synchronous servomotors exhibit harmonic components in the current control circuit. The current observer suppresses these harmonic components so that they cannot.

# 7.3.6.3 Overmodulation

The ""usqref"" and ""usdref"" components permit so-called overmodulation of the DC link voltage (limitation to hexagon instead of circle). The maximum output voltage which can be set for each phase angle results from the circle which fits in the voltage hexagon (see diagram Section ""“Circle and hexagon voltages” diagram"" on page 128).

By setting the hexagonal modulation to ""HEX_PHASE(3)"" using P 432 - CON_CCON_Mode, the length of the vector for the output voltage can be placed in the range of the DC link voltage (red). As a result only two of the three half-bridges are switched in each switching interval. The third remains at the upper or lower potential of the DC link voltage for a period of 60° of the output frequency.

This method has only two thirds of the switching losses of modulation with all three phases. Disadvantages are higher harmonics of the motor currents and thus less smooth running at high motor speeds.

P 434.6 enables filtering of the voltage thus set, which reduces noise. Do not set this filter too high, otherwise there will no longer be an increase in bandwidth.
