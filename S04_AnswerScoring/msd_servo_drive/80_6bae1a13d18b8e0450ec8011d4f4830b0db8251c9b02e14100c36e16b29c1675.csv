# 9.6 Motor brake output

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

- The response when a position limit is reached (P 2235 - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit) will depend on the error response that has been configured (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

NOTE

- The response when a position limit is reached (P 2235 - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit) will depend on the error response that has been configured (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

NOTE

l When using homing methods -8, -9, -10, and -11, P 332[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxScale is replaced by P 225[0] - MPRO_REF_HOMING_TMaxScale.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

# 9.6 Motor brake output

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

NOTE

On the MSD Single-Axis Servo Drive Compact, the motor brake output for frame sizes 2 to 5 will be found on connector X13.

On the MSD Servo Drive (Single-Axis System and Multi-Axis System), the motor brake output...

- For frame sizes 1 to 4 will be found on connector X13
- For frame sizes 5 to 6a will be found on connector X20
- For frame size 7 will be found on connector X44

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

l When using homing methods -8, -9, -10, and -11, P 332[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxScale is replaced by P 225[0] - MPRO_REF_HOMING_TMaxScale.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

NOTE

- The response when a position limit is reached (P 2235 - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit) will depend on the error response that has been configured (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 9.6 Motor brake output

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

NOTE

- The response when a position limit is reached (P 2235 - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit) will depend on the error response that has been configured (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

NOTE

l When using homing methods -8, -9, -10, and -11, P 332[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxScale is replaced by P 225[0] - MPRO_REF_HOMING_TMaxScale.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

# 9.6 Motor brake output

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

NOTE

On the MSD Single-Axis Servo Drive Compact, the motor brake output for frame sizes 2 to 5 will be found on connector X13.

On the MSD Servo Drive (Single-Axis System and Multi-Axis System), the motor brake output...

- For frame sizes 1 to 4 will be found on connector X13
- For frame sizes 5 to 6a will be found on connector X20
- For frame size 7 will be found on connector X44

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

- For frame sizes 1 to 4 will be found on connector X13
- For frame sizes 5 to 6a will be found on connector X20
- For frame size 7 will be found on connector X44

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

- The response when a position limit is reached (P 2235 - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit) will depend on the error response that has been configured (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 9.6 Motor brake output

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

- For frame sizes 5 to 6a will be found on connector X20
- For frame size 7 will be found on connector X44

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

NOTE

l When using homing methods -8, -9, -10, and -11, P 332[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxScale is replaced by P 225[0] - MPRO_REF_HOMING_TMaxScale.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

On the MSD Single-Axis Servo Drive Compact, the motor brake output for frame sizes 2 to 5 will be found on connector X13.

- For frame sizes 1 to 4 will be found on connector X13
- For frame sizes 5 to 6a will be found on connector X20
- For frame size 7 will be found on connector X44

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

l When using homing methods -8, -9, -10, and -11, P 332[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxScale is replaced by P 225[0] - MPRO_REF_HOMING_TMaxScale.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

- The response when a position limit is reached (P 2235 - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit) will depend on the error response that has been configured (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

l When using homing methods -8, -9, -10, and -11, P 332[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxScale is replaced by P 225[0] - MPRO_REF_HOMING_TMaxScale.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

- For frame sizes 5 to 6a will be found on connector X20
- For frame size 7 will be found on connector X44

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 9.6 Motor brake output

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

- The response when a position limit is reached (P 2235 - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit) will depend on the error response that has been configured (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

l When using homing methods -8, -9, -10, and -11, P 332[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxScale is replaced by P 225[0] - MPRO_REF_HOMING_TMaxScale.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

On the MSD Single-Axis Servo Drive Compact, the motor brake output for frame sizes 2 to 5 will be found on connector X13.

- For frame sizes 1 to 4 will be found on connector X13
- For frame sizes 5 to 6a will be found on connector X20
- For frame size 7 will be found on connector X44

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

l When using homing methods -8, -9, -10, and -11, P 332[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxScale is replaced by P 225[0] - MPRO_REF_HOMING_TMaxScale.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

- The response when a position limit is reached (P 2235 - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit) will depend on the error response that has been configured (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

l When using homing methods -8, -9, -10, and -11, P 332[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxScale is replaced by P 225[0] - MPRO_REF_HOMING_TMaxScale.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

- For frame sizes 5 to 6a will be found on connector X20
- For frame size 7 will be found on connector X44

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

# 9.6 Motor brake output

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

Image 10.1: “Limitations and thresholds” screen

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

- The response when a position limit is reached (P 2235 - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit) will depend on the error response that has been configured (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

# 10 Limitations / Thresholds

# 10.4 Position limitation

- Position limiting is only applicable in positioning mode and will be enabled only once homing is successfully completed (see Section ""Homing"" on page 249).
- P 2235[0] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the lower position limit. P 2235[1] - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit is used to define the upper position limit. This function is also referred to as “software limit switches”.
- In addition, P 743[0] - MON_UsrPosDiffMax can be used to define the maximum tracking error.
- P 746[0] - MON_UsrPosWindow can be used to define the zero speed window (position setpoint reached).

Positioning mode

Before enabling an absolute motion task, a check is made whether the target is in the valid range – that is, within the software limit switches. If the target is outside, no motion task is signalled and the programmed error reaction as per P 30 Error Reactions is executed.

This mode can only be used when using speed-controlled operation. The drive travels until a software limit switch is detected. Then the programmed error reaction is executed.

- The response when a position limit is reached (P 2235 - MPRO_402_SoftwarePosLimit) will depend on the error response that has been configured (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).

# 10.5 Power stage

- If the value for the DC link voltage exceeds the value set in parameter P 747 [0] - MON_PF_OnLimit, error ERR-34 ""Power failure detected"" is reported and the parameterized error reaction is triggered (see Section ""Error reactions"" on page 325).
- By setting a quickstop as the error reaction in the parameters using an adequately steep deceleration ramp, the DC link voltage can be maintained above the undervoltage threshold (see Section ""Power failure bridging"" on page 28). This reaction lasts until the drive has been braked to a lower speed.

# 9.6 Motor brake output

P 748[0] - MON_MotorBrkGuard can be used to activate a monitoring mechanism at the motor brake output that will monitor both wire breaks and current. The brake function can also be used in the other digital outputs, though without current and wire break monitoring.

If the output is set to BRAKE(2), the brake can be configured with the “Options...” button (see Section ""Motor brake details"" on page 309).

NOTE

On the MSD Single-Axis Servo Drive Compact, the motor brake output for frame sizes 2 to 5 will be found on connector X13.

On the MSD Servo Drive (Single-Axis System and Multi-Axis System), the motor brake output...

- For frame sizes 1 to 4 will be found on connector X13
- For frame sizes 5 to 6a will be found on connector X20
- For frame size 7 will be found on connector X44

An optional holding brake built-in to motor provides protection against unwanted motion when the power is cut and in case of error. If the brake is mounted on the axis mechanism and not directly on the shaft, note that undesirably severe torsional forces may occur on sudden engagement of the brake.

The P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE function selector can be used to select any function (similar to those for the digital outputs) for the motor brake output. However, the special motor brake control section hardware will be used for the selected function.

However, when using a motor brake with P 125[0] - MPRO_OUTPUT_FS_MOTOR_BRAKE = BRAKE(2), the criteria for braking need to be defined. This criteria can consist of a variety of states, limits, threshold values, input signals, and fieldbus commands.

To protect the device, the motor and the complete plant it is necessary to limit the variables torque, speed and position. These limits act independently of other limitations within the motion profile.

The limits are specified as percentages of the rated quantities (current, torque, speed,...), so that following calculation logical default settings are available. The defaults relate to 100% of the ratings. The parameters must therefore be adapted to application and motor. The motor quantity limits can be read out in P 338[0] - CON_SCON_ActMax.

l When using homing methods -8, -9, -10, and -11, P 332[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxScale is replaced by P 225[0] - MPRO_REF_HOMING_TMaxScale.

l To protect against overspeed if a requested torque is not reached, P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale is used to limit the speed controller to a percentage of the rated speed.

# 10.3 Speed- / velocity limits

- P 328[0] - CON_SCON_SMax can be used to set the maximum speed limit. In the default setting the speed limit is the same as the rated speed of the motor. The possible setting range is 0-2000%. The parameter cannot be changed during operation. A change is only effective after restarting the control.
- P 337[0] - CON_SCON_SMaxScale enables the torque limit set in P 328[0] to be scaled online – that is, during operation.
- It is additionally possible via P 333[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxNeg and P 334[0] - CON_SCON_TMaxPos to change the torque limit for different directions of rotation during operation.
- P 744[0] - MON_SDiffMax is used to specify the permissible difference between the setpoint speed and the actual speed (tracking error) in revolutions.
- P 745[0] - MON_RefWindow is used to define the point at which the setpoint is considered to have been reached.
