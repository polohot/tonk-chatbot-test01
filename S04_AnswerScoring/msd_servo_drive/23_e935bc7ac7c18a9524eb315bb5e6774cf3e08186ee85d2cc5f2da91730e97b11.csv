P 617[0] - ENC_CH1_AbsInitMode = Mode absolute value formation

# value initialization:

- DIG_ANA(0)- Standard:
Absolute value initialization using a mix of the digital and analog components (this is the default mode)
- DIG(1) - Digital:
Only the digital component will be used for the absolute value initialization.
- SEK_SEL37(2) - Automatic:
Digital if ST bits > (LineBits + 8); otherwise standard (criterion applies with HIPERFACE SEKL-37 encoders)
- SSI_180(3) - Same as Standard, except:
In the case of SSI, the quadrant alignment of the digital value relative to the analog Sin/Cos tracks is not the same as with EnDat, but is instead offset by 180 degrees relative to EnDat, i.e. in the “natural Q alignment” for the digital value relative to the tracks.

P 1900[0] - ENC_ETS = ETS mode, electronic nameplate

The parameter ENC_ETS supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate” for HIPERFACE encoders. If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

# 6.5.4.2.5 SSI absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI(1), which is the normal setting, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the SSI interface are described in Section ""SSI (cyclical) X7"" on page 69, as are the differences in using the SSI interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6 Encoder

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.6 EnDat absolute value interface

# 6.5.4.2.7 HIPERFACE absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = HIPER(3), the absolute HIPERFACE encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

HIPERFACE functionality: After an SW reset is carried out from the HIPERFACE encoder as the very first step, the ID byte, referred to as the “TypeKey”, will be read from the encoder and interpreted: If it is equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

# 6.5.4.2.5 SSI absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI(1), which is the normal setting, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the SSI interface are described in Section ""SSI (cyclical) X7"" on page 69, as are the differences in using the SSI interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6 Encoder

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.7 HIPERFACE absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = HIPER(3), the absolute HIPERFACE encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

HIPERFACE functionality: After an SW reset is carried out from the HIPERFACE encoder as the very first step, the ID byte, referred to as the “TypeKey”, will be read from the encoder and interpreted: If it is equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.6 EnDat absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = ENDAT(2), the absolute EnDat encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the EnDat interface are described in Section ""EnDat (cyclical) X7"" on page 61, as are the differences in using the EnDat interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

HIPERFACE functionality: After an SW reset is carried out from the HIPERFACE encoder as the very first step, the ID byte, referred to as the “TypeKey”, will be read from the encoder and interpreted: If it is equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

AbsEncStatus is used to display status information for HIPERFACE encoders. In index [0], the read “TypeKey” for the HIPERFACE encoder will be indicated (one byte). Bytes 1–4 of the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be shown in indexes [5..8] (00h means “no error”). Index [9] will specify how many error status bytes were read in the last read operation.

NOTE

With P 1900 - ENC_ETS, the HIPERFACE interface also supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate.” If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

AbsEncStatus is used to display status information for HIPERFACE encoders. In index [0], the read “TypeKey” for the HIPERFACE encoder will be indicated (one byte). Bytes 1–4 of the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be shown in indexes [5..8] (00h means “no error”). Index [9] will specify how many error status bytes were read in the last read operation.

NOTE

l Pay attention to the encoder initialization entries in the Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5 message window. In the event of an error, also check the entries in P 552 - ENC_CH1_AbsEncStatus.

With P 1900 - ENC_ETS, the HIPERFACE interface also supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate.” If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

P 1900[0] - ENC_ETS = ETS mode, electronic nameplate

The parameter ENC_ETS supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate” for HIPERFACE encoders. If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning).

The parameters for the SSI interface are described in Section ""SSI (cyclical) X7"" on page 69, as are the differences in using the SSI interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6 Encoder

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.6 EnDat absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = ENDAT(2), the absolute EnDat encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the EnDat interface are described in Section ""EnDat (cyclical) X7"" on page 61, as are the differences in using the EnDat interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6.5.4.2.7 HIPERFACE absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = HIPER(3), the absolute HIPERFACE encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

SSI (Synchronous Serial Interface) is a digital encoder interface that is supported by a large number of manufacturers.

P 617[0] - ENC_CH1_AbsInitMode = Mode absolute value formation

# value initialization:

- DIG_ANA(0)- Standard:
Absolute value initialization using a mix of the digital and analog components (this is the default mode)
- DIG(1) - Digital:
Only the digital component will be used for the absolute value initialization.
- SEK_SEL37(2) - Automatic:
Digital if ST bits > (LineBits + 8); otherwise standard (criterion applies with HIPERFACE SEKL-37 encoders)
- SSI_180(3) - Same as Standard, except:
In the case of SSI, the quadrant alignment of the digital value relative to the analog Sin/Cos tracks is not the same as with EnDat, but is instead offset by 180 degrees relative to EnDat, i.e. in the “natural Q alignment” for the digital value relative to the tracks.

P 1900[0] - ENC_ETS = ETS mode, electronic nameplate

The parameter ENC_ETS supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate” for HIPERFACE encoders. If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning).

# 6.5.4.2.5 SSI absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI(1), which is the normal setting, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the SSI interface are described in Section ""SSI (cyclical) X7"" on page 69, as are the differences in using the SSI interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6 Encoder

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.6 EnDat absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = ENDAT(2), the absolute EnDat encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the EnDat interface are described in Section ""EnDat (cyclical) X7"" on page 61, as are the differences in using the EnDat interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6.5.4.2.7 HIPERFACE absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = HIPER(3), the absolute HIPERFACE encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

HIPERFACE functionality: After an SW reset is carried out from the HIPERFACE encoder as the very first step, the ID byte, referred to as the “TypeKey”, will be read from the encoder and interpreted: If it is equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

SSI (Synchronous Serial Interface) is a digital encoder interface that is supported by a large number of manufacturers. It is not standardized, meaning that manufacturers are free to support the interface as they like. ",What are the different modes of absolute value initialization mentioned in the document?,A4,"Four modes are listed: Standard (default), Digital, Automatic (for HIPERFACE SEKL-37 encoders), and SSI_180 (with a natural Q alignment offset).",2.90625,2.9375,4.0,1.5703125,0.62890625

P 617[0] - ENC_CH1_AbsInitMode = Mode absolute value formation

# value initialization:

- DIG_ANA(0)- Standard:
Absolute value initialization using a mix of the digital and analog components (this is the default mode)
- DIG(1) - Digital:
Only the digital component will be used for the absolute value initialization.
- SEK_SEL37(2) - Automatic:
Digital if ST bits > (LineBits + 8); otherwise standard (criterion applies with HIPERFACE SEKL-37 encoders)
- SSI_180(3) - Same as Standard, except:
In the case of SSI, the quadrant alignment of the digital value relative to the analog Sin/Cos tracks is not the same as with EnDat, but is instead offset by 180 degrees relative to EnDat, i.e. in the “natural Q alignment” for the digital value relative to the tracks.

P 1900[0] - ENC_ETS = ETS mode, electronic nameplate

The parameter ENC_ETS supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate” for HIPERFACE encoders. If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

# 6.5.4.2.5 SSI absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI(1), which is the normal setting, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the SSI interface are described in Section ""SSI (cyclical) X7"" on page 69, as are the differences in using the SSI interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6 Encoder

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.6 EnDat absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = ENDAT(2), the absolute EnDat encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the EnDat interface are described in Section ""EnDat (cyclical) X7"" on page 61, as are the differences in using the EnDat interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6.5.4.2.7 HIPERFACE absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = HIPER(3), the absolute HIPERFACE encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

HIPERFACE functionality: After an SW reset is carried out from the HIPERFACE encoder as the very first step, the ID byte, referred to as the “TypeKey”, will be read from the encoder and interpreted: If it is equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and

# 6 Encoder

MOOG ID No.:CB40859-001 Date:11/2020

MSD ServoDrive - DeviceHelp 68

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

P 617[0] - ENC_CH1_AbsInitMode = Mode absolute value formation

# value initialization:

- DIG_ANA(0)- Standard:
Absolute value initialization using a mix of the digital and analog components (this is the default mode)
- DIG(1) - Digital:
Only the digital component will be used for the absolute value initialization.
- SEK_SEL37(2) - Automatic:
Digital if ST bits > (LineBits + 8); otherwise standard (criterion applies with HIPERFACE SEKL-37 encoders)
- SSI_180(3) - Same as Standard, except:
In the case of SSI, the quadrant alignment of the digital value relative to the analog Sin/Cos tracks is not the same as with EnDat, but is instead offset by 180 degrees relative to EnDat, i.e. in the “natural Q alignment” for the digital value relative to the tracks.

P 1900[0] - ENC_ETS = ETS mode, electronic nameplate

The parameter ENC_ETS supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate” for HIPERFACE encoders. If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

# 6.5.4.2.5 SSI absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI(1), which is the normal setting, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the SSI interface are described in Section ""SSI (cyclical) X7"" on page 69, as are the differences in using the SSI interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6 Encoder

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.6 EnDat absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = ENDAT(2), the absolute EnDat encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the EnDat interface are described in Section ""EnDat (cyclical) X7"" on page 61, as are the differences in using the EnDat interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6.5.4.2.7 HIPERFACE absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = HIPER(3), the absolute HIPERFACE encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

HIPERFACE functionality: After an SW reset is carried out from the HIPERFACE encoder as the very first step, the ID byte, referred to as the “TypeKey”, will be read from the encoder and interpreted: If it is equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

P 1900[0] - ENC_ETS = ETS mode, electronic nameplate

The parameter ENC_ETS supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate” for HIPERFACE encoders. If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

# 6.5.4.2.5 SSI absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI(1), which is the normal setting, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the SSI interface are described in Section ""SSI (cyclical) X7"" on page 69, as are the differences in using the SSI interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6 Encoder

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.6 EnDat absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = ENDAT(2), the absolute EnDat encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = HIPER(3), the absolute HIPERFACE encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

HIPERFACE functionality: After an SW reset is carried out from the HIPERFACE encoder as the very first step, the ID byte, referred to as the “TypeKey”, will be read from the encoder and interpreted: If it is equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.6 EnDat absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = ENDAT(2), the absolute EnDat encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the EnDat interface are described in Section ""EnDat (cyclical) X7"" on page 61, as are the differences in using the EnDat interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6.5.4.2.7 HIPERFACE absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = HIPER(3), the absolute HIPERFACE encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

HIPERFACE functionality: After an SW reset is carried out from the HIPERFACE encoder as the very first step, the ID byte, referred to as the “TypeKey”, will be read from the encoder and interpreted: If it is equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

AbsEncStatus is used to display status information for HIPERFACE encoders. In index [0], the read “TypeKey” for the HIPERFACE encoder will be indicated (one byte). Bytes 1–4 of the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be shown in indexes [5..8] (00h means “no error”). Index [9] will specify how many error status bytes were read in the last read operation.

NOTE

l Pay attention to the encoder initialization entries in the Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5 message window. In the event of an error, also check the entries in P 552 - ENC_CH1_AbsEncStatus.

With P 1900 - ENC_ETS, the HIPERFACE interface also supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate.” If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = HIPER(3), the absolute HIPERFACE encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

HIPERFACE functionality: After an SW reset is carried out from the HIPERFACE encoder as the very first step, the ID byte, referred to as the “TypeKey”, will be read from the encoder and interpreted: If it is equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

AbsEncStatus is used to display status information for HIPERFACE encoders. In index [0], the read “TypeKey” for the HIPERFACE encoder will be indicated (one byte). Bytes 1–4 of the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be shown in indexes [5..8] (00h means “no error”). Index [9] will specify how many error status bytes were read in the last read operation.

NOTE

With P 1900 - ENC_ETS, the HIPERFACE interface also supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate.” If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data.

AbsEncStatus is used to display status information for HIPERFACE encoders. In index [0], the read “TypeKey” for the HIPERFACE encoder will be indicated (one byte). Bytes 1–4 of the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be shown in indexes [5..8] (00h means “no error”). Index [9] will specify how many error status bytes were read in the last read operation.

The parameter ENC_ETS supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate” for HIPERFACE encoders.

# 6 Encoder

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

Index [9] will specify how many error status bytes were read in the last read operation.

NOTE

l Pay attention to the encoder initialization entries in the Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5 message window. In the event of an error, also check the entries in P 552 - ENC_CH1_AbsEncStatus.

With P 1900 - ENC_ETS, the HIPERFACE interface also supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate.” If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

The parameter ENC_ETS supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate” for HIPERFACE encoders. If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning).

The parameters for the SSI interface are described in Section ""SSI (cyclical) X7"" on page 69, as are the differences in using the SSI interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6 Encoder

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.6 EnDat absolute value interface

# 6.5.4.2.7 HIPERFACE absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = HIPER(3), the absolute HIPERFACE encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

Absolute value initialization using a mix of the digital and analog components (this is the default mode)
- DIG(1) - Digital:
Only the digital component will be used for the absolute value initialization.

- SSI_180(3) - Same as Standard, except:
In the case of SSI, the quadrant alignment of the digital value relative to the analog Sin/Cos tracks is not the same as with EnDat, but is instead offset by 180 degrees relative to EnDat, i.e. in the “natural Q alignment” for the digital value relative to the tracks.

P 1900[0] - ENC_ETS = ETS mode, electronic nameplate

The parameter ENC_ETS supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate” for HIPERFACE encoders. If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

# 6.5.4.2.5 SSI absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI(1), which is the normal setting, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the SSI interface are described in Section ""SSI (cyclical) X7"" on page 69, as are the differences in using the SSI interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6 Encoder

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.6 EnDat absolute value interface

# 6.5.4.2.7 HIPERFACE absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = HIPER(3), the absolute HIPERFACE encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

HIPERFACE functionality: After an SW reset is carried out from the HIPERFACE encoder as the very first step, the ID byte, referred to as the “TypeKey”, will be read from the encoder and interpreted: If it is equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

P 1900[0] - ENC_ETS = ETS mode, electronic nameplate

The parameter ENC_ETS supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate” for HIPERFACE encoders. If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI(1), which is the normal setting, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the SSI interface are described in Section ""SSI (cyclical) X7"" on page 69, as are the differences in using the SSI interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6 Encoder

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.6 EnDat absolute value interface

The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

HIPERFACE functionality: After an SW reset is carried out from the HIPERFACE encoder as the very first step, the ID byte, referred to as the “TypeKey”, will be read from the encoder and interpreted: If it is equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).

P 1900[0] - ENC_ETS = ETS mode, electronic nameplate

The parameter ENC_ETS supports what is referred to as the “Moog electronic rating plate” for HIPERFACE encoders. If this parameter is set to SCAN(0), the motor’s commutation offset will be read from the encoder’s OEM memory and copied to P 349 - CON_FM_MConOffset, but only if this offset can be unambiguously identified in the encoder (encoder memory scanning). If the parameter is set to NEVER(0) instead, this functionality will be disabled.

# 6.5.4.2.5 SSI absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI(1), which is the normal setting, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component.

The parameters for the SSI interface are described in Section ""SSI (cyclical) X7"" on page 69, as are the differences in using the SSI interface with the “cyclical” method and “one-time reading” method.

# 6 Encoder

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = SSI_CONT(4), which is a special case, the absolute SSI encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The reason this is a special case is that the SSI clock will continue to be cyclically output on the SSI clock lines, in contrast to the SSI(1) setting. This means that the connected SSI encoder will continue to cyclically deliver position data on the SSI data lines. However, once the SSI data is read once, the controller will not evaluate any additional SSI data. This functionality can be used in the special case if the 485 system is implemented as a bus system on the encoder side so that a third 485 node (e.g. a controller) can “also listen in to” the SSI position data as an SSI clock slave.

# 6.5.4.2.6 EnDat absolute value interface

# 6.5.4.2.7 HIPERFACE absolute value interface

If P 540[0] - ENC_CH1_Abs = HIPER(3), the absolute HIPERFACE encoder position will be read once during the initialization phase; after this, the cyclical encoder position will be acquired based on the Sin/Cos incremental component. The HIPERFACE interface will not be used as an alternative to cyclical encoder position acquisition.

HIPERFACE functionality: After an SW reset is carried out from the HIPERFACE encoder as the very first step, the ID byte, referred to as the “TypeKey”, will be read from the encoder and interpreted: If it is equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and

SingleT will be read from the EN (HIPERFACE® electronic rating plate) on the encoder. If it is not equal to FFh, the data for Lines, MultiT and SingleT will be taken from a characteristic table in the controller firmware. In the case of linear encoder types, the corresponding parameters will be PeriodLen and DigitalResolution.

HIPERFACE encoders “unknown at the time of writing” (new: no entry in the firmware characteristic table) are generally not supported! In the case of known encoders, the Lines, MultiT, SingleT, PeriodLen and DigitalResolution parameters will be overwritten with the determined values. After this, the HIPERFACE encoder’s internal 4-byte error status memory will be read. Then, the position will be read once from the encoder. If any errors that result in new entries in the internal error memory occur at this point, the error memory will be read again and interpreted accordingly (error message if applicable).
