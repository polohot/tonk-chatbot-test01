The first step in commissioning sensorless control is correctly determining the motor data and control parameters and configuring them accordingly. At this point, it is especially important to ensure that the inductance difference between the motor’s d and q axes is set correctly. This can be done with P 480[0] - MOT_Lsq. If this parameter is not available (older firmware), P 472[0] - MOT_LsigDiff can be used to set the difference as a percentage.

In order to obtain an accurate number, the values for the d and q inductances should:

- Be obtained from the motor manufacturer’s data sheet or the motor data set OR
- Be requested from the motor manufacturer OR
- Be measured by Moog with an “advanced motor identification” routine OR
- Be determined as an approximation for most motors with the motor identification routine

If none of these options is available, it is possible to start with a rough setting of Lq = 110% • Ld for a test with a servomotor. However, you must then be ready for limited operation within a narrow speed range.

The first step in commissioning sensorless control is correctly determining the motor data and control parameters and configuring them accordingly. At this point, it is especially important to ensure that the inductance difference between the motor’s d and q axes is set correctly. This can be done with P 480[0] - MOT_Lsq. If this parameter is not available (older firmware), P 472[0] - MOT_LsigDiff can be used to set the difference as a percentage.

The first step in commissioning sensorless control is correctly determining the motor data and control parameters and configuring them accordingly. At this point, it is especially important to ensure that the inductance difference between the motor’s d and q axes is set correctly. This can be done with P 480[0] - MOT_Lsq. If this parameter is not available (older firmware), P 472[0] - MOT_LsigDiff can be used to set the difference as a percentage.

In order to obtain an accurate number, the values for the d and q inductances should:

- Be requested from the motor manufacturer OR
- Be measured by Moog with an “advanced motor identification” routine OR

The angular change describes the difference between two predicted angular positions from consecutive sampling steps. Dividing eps_diff by the observer’s sampling time yields speed n_eps, which, although admittedly noisier than the calculated Kalman filter speed, is accurate in a steady state. However, the heavy noise means that relatively long filter times are required, resulting in the loss of some of the control circuit’s dynamic performance.

In order to be able to use a control scheme with high dynamic performance and steady-state accuracy, a circuit must be put together using two actual speed values (the speed from the angular derivative [n_eps] and the speed from the Kalman filter [n_kal]).

# 6.8.1.4 Commissioning

The first step in commissioning sensorless control is correctly determining the motor data and control parameters and configuring them accordingly. At this point, it is especially important to ensure that the inductance difference between the motor’s d and q axes is set correctly. This can be done with P 480[0] - MOT_Lsq. If this parameter is not available (older firmware), P 472[0] - MOT_LsigDiff can be used to set the difference as a percentage.

In order to obtain an accurate number, the values for the d and q inductances should:

- Be obtained from the motor manufacturer’s data sheet or the motor data set OR
- Be requested from the motor manufacturer OR
- Be measured by Moog with an “advanced motor identification” routine OR
- Be determined as an approximation for most motors with the motor identification routine

If none of these options is available, it is possible to start with a rough setting of Lq = 110% • Ld for a test with a servomotor. However, you must then be ready for limited operation within a narrow speed range.
