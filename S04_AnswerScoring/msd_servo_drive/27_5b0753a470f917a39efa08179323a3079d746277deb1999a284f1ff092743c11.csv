# 6.6.2 Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)

The resolver and Sin/Cos incremental encoder demonstrate systematic errors that are reflected in the measured position and in the speed calculated from this (gain and phase errors, offset components of the tracking signal). The GPOC method for track signal correction compensates systematic errors. GPOC is available for encoder channels 1 and 2.

# 6.6.2 Signal correction GPOC (Gain Phase Offset Correction)

The resolver and Sin/Cos incremental encoder demonstrate systematic errors that are reflected in the measured position and in the speed calculated from this (gain and phase errors, offset components of the tracking signal). The GPOC method for track signal correction compensates systematic errors. GPOC is available for encoder channels 1 and 2.
