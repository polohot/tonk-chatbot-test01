# Control mode

- AUTO_COMPLETE (4) = via auto complete mode (parameter no. 204)
- NOTE: As with ""AUTO (2)"", as long as the input is set, the table will be executed. After being deactivated, the entire table will be run through to the end once more.

“Control mode” does not refer to the motor control here (see Section ""Control"" on page 108), but rather to the source that will specify the table index!

P 205[0] - MPRO_TAB_Mode is used to define which source will specify the table index:

- PARA (0) = via current index (parameter no. 207)
- The value written to P 207[0] - MPRO_TAB_ActIdx (via a fieldbus, for example) will immediately be applied as the current table index and the corresponding driving job will be carried out.

TERM (1) = via terminals
- A bit pattern that will be applied as the value for the table index will be specified via digital inputs. In order to be able to select all 16 table entries, four digital inputs with TAB0(23) = Binary table index 20 to TAB3(26) = Binary table index 23 need to be configured. For details on configuring the digital inputs, see Section ""Digital inputs"" on page 290.

AUTO (2) = via time delay (parameter no. 204)
- Automatic processing of follow-up driving jobs. The number of driving jobs entered in parameter P 206[0] - MPRO_Tab_MaxIdx is processed in sequence. This operation is repeated until the drive is stopped or the table is disabled. There will be a wait time of P 204 - MPRO_TAB_WaitTime between the individual driving jobs.

BUS (3) = via fieldbus

# 8 Motion profile

P 203 - MPRO_TAB_PMode is used to define the type of positioning used:

- ABS(0) = Absolute
Absolute positioning
- REL(1) = Relative (after “target reached”)
Relative positioning after target position reached.
- REL at once(2) = Relative (at once)
Aborts a current motion task and moves, as of the current position, to the new reference.
- SPEED(3) = Endless (speed controlled)
If a table value is set to SPEED, an infinite motion task is transmitted. If a table value with the setting ABS or REL is additionally selected, the infinite job is quit and the newly selected table value is approached from the current position.

# Speed

If the Servo Drive is run with motor control mode ""PCON(3) = Position control mode"" (for information on the setting, see Section ""Basic settings"" on page 110), the “Mode” and “Speed” lines will be added to the “Setpoint table” screen.

P 201 - MPRO_TAB_PSpd is used to define the speed for a motion task.

# Acceleration

With ...

- P 193 - MPRO_TAB_TAcc (for torque control) or
- P 196 - MPRO_TAB_SAcc (for speed control) or
- P 199 - MPRO_TAB_PAcc (for position control)

and indexes 0–15, the accelerations for moving to the setpoint for each individual motion task can be defined. The input must not be zero.
