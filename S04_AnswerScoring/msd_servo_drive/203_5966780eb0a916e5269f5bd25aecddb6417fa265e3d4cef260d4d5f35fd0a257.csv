- Please check the bus system connection. Try to replace the cables.
- Please try to reduce computational load on the master.
- Try to increase the master cycle time.

# 11.6.31.3 Error 32-3 (emergency code 8100h)

Cause: Profinet IRT: sign of life fault!

Suggested steps:

- This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.
- Please check the device cabling for proper connection.
- Please check device grounding, i.e. the connection to a metal backplane and cabinet connection to earth.
- Check motor grounding and motor cable length.
- The device was probably disconnected from the master controller, or the master is overloaded.
- Please check the bus system connection. Try to replace the cables.
- Please try to reduce computational load on the master.
- Try to increase the master cycle time.
