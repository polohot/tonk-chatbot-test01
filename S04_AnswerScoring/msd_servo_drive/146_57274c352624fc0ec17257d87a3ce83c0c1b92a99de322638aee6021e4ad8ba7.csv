# 11 Alarms & warnings

# 11.6.17.2 Error 16-2 (emergency code 8400h)

Cause: Current speed above maximum speed of motor > 120%

# Suggested steps:

- Check your parameter data set

The control system failed to track the reference value

- Please check if the axis is blocked.
- Try to reduce acceleration or deceleration.
- If reference speed is higher than the motor rated speed, please check field weakening settings. In field-weakening range, the available torque per current is reduced.

The speed control might run away, most likely due to a wrong encoder offset.

- Please check that the encoder offset is set properly.
- If auto commutation is used, re-view the auto commutation setting and test under all possible conditions.
- If torque mode is used, reduce torque, ensure external speed limitation, or increase speed control gain for stronger limitation.

This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.

- Please check the device cabling for proper connection.
- Please check device grounding, i.e. the connection to a metal backplane and cabinet connection to earth.
- Check motor grounding and motor cable length.

# 11.6.18 Error 17: Position difference error

# 11 Alarms & warnings

# 11.6.17.2 Error 16-2 (emergency code 8400h)

Cause: Current speed above maximum speed of motor > 120%

# Suggested steps:

- Check your parameter data set

The control system failed to track the reference value

- Please check if the axis is blocked.
- Try to reduce acceleration or deceleration.
- If reference speed is higher than the motor rated speed, please check field weakening settings. In field-weakening range, the available torque per current is reduced.

The speed control might run away, most likely due to a wrong encoder offset.

- Please check that the encoder offset is set properly.
- If auto commutation is used, re-view the auto commutation setting and test under all possible conditions.
- If torque mode is used, reduce torque, ensure external speed limitation, or increase speed control gain for stronger limitation.

This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.

- Please check the device cabling for proper connection.
- Please check device grounding, i.e. the connection to a metal backplane and cabinet connection to earth.
- Check motor grounding and motor cable length.

The control system failed to track the reference value

- Please check if the axis is blocked.
- Try to reduce acceleration or deceleration.
- If reference speed is higher than the motor rated speed, please check field weakening settings. In field-weakening range, the available torque per current is reduced.

The speed control might run away, most likely due to a wrong encoder offset.

- Please check that the encoder offset is set properly.
- If auto commutation is used, re-view the auto commutation setting and test under all possible conditions.
- If torque mode is used, reduce torque, ensure external speed limitation, or increase speed control gain for stronger limitation.

This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.

- Please check the device cabling for proper connection.
- Please check device grounding, i.e. the connection to a metal backplane and cabinet connection to earth.
- Check motor grounding and motor cable length.

# 11.6.17.2 Error 16-2 (emergency code 8400h)

Cause: Current speed above maximum speed of motor > 120%

# Suggested steps:

- Check your parameter data set

The control system failed to track the reference value

- Please check if the axis is blocked.
- Try to reduce acceleration or deceleration.
- If reference speed is higher than the motor rated speed, please check field weakening settings. In field-weakening range, the available torque per current is reduced.

The speed control might run away, most likely due to a wrong encoder offset.

- Please check that the encoder offset is set properly.
- If auto commutation is used, re-view the auto commutation setting and test under all possible conditions.
- If torque mode is used, reduce torque, ensure external speed limitation, or increase speed control gain for stronger limitation.

This is possibly an EMC issue. This is very likely if the problem occurs when switching on motor control and/or when connecting DC link power supply.

- Please check the device cabling for proper connection.
- Please check device grounding, i.e. the connection to a metal backplane and cabinet connection to earth.
- Check motor grounding and motor cable length.
