Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

# 6.5 Channel 1: Interface X7

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

# 6.5 Channel 1: Interface X7

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

# 6.5 Channel 1: Interface X7

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

# 6.5 Channel 1: Interface X7

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

NOTE

- This section only lists the most important connectors and pinouts so as to make commissioning easier.
- For a full description of the encoder connectors (designation, position, pinout, function) for correctly installing the devices, see the “Encoder connection” chapter in the Operation Manual MSD Servo Drive Single-Axis System (ID No.: CA65642-001), Operation Manual MSD Servo Drive Multi-Axis System (ID No.: CA97554-001), Operation Manual MSD Single-Axis Servo Drive Compact (ID No.: CA97555-001), and the MSD Servo Drive Specification on functional safety in the case of Servo Drives with an “integrated safety control” design (ID No.: CB38398-001).
- Please note that the pinouts for evaluating the zero pulse for the MSD Servo Drive and MSD Single-Axis Servo Drive Compact are different from each other.
- If your Servo Drive comes with a technology option with an encoder function (X8 connector), see the corresponding Specification for a description of the encoder connections (see Section ""Applicable documentation"" on page 12).

NOTE

The current used to determine the encoder offset (commutation offset) is specified by P 457[0] - MOT_CNom. This value should be reduced if the acceleration has too much jerk.

# 6.5 Channel 1: Interface X7

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

# 6.5 Channel 1: Interface X7

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

# 6.5 Channel 1: Interface X7

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

# 6.5 Channel 1: Interface X7

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.

# 6.5 Channel 1: Interface X7

Select from database

Clicking on this button will open a menu that can be used to select encoders. The data sets for Moog encoders will already be available there by default.

# Encoder name

You can use this field to enter your own information for describing the encoder (maximum 31 characters) (P 555[0] - ENC_CH1_Info).

# Cyclic position via

This drop-down menu is used to select the “main interface” (P 505[0] - ENC_CH1_Sel).

# Pulses per revolution

Once SINCOS(1), TTL(3) or HALL(5) is selected as the “main interface,” this field will appear so that you can enter the number of analog Sin/Cos lines per revolution (TTL lines as well).

# Image 6.2: Encoder configuration Channel Ch1 (Interface X7) screen

# Absolute interface

This screen is used to select the encoder for channel Ch1. This channel uses the encoder’s “main interface” to measure position changes periodically and add them up cyclically – this is referred to as “cyclical evaluation”.

Encoders with a main interface that only makes it possible to measure the cyclical position incrementally often feature an additional absolute value interface referred to as an “auxiliary interface”. For this interface, the absolute position is measured once during the initialization phase and is then used for absolute value initialization purposes.

# NOTE

l Selecting an “auxiliary interface” is redundant if, for example, SSI (2) is selected as the “main interface” (corresponds to cyclical evaluation via SSI). In this case, the absolute value initialization will also be carried out via the SSI interface, regardless of the selected “auxiliary interface”.

# Gear ratio

These fields can be used to define a gear ratio for the encoder (in the output side). For details see Section ""Encoder gearing"" on page 89.
