# 6.9 Redundant encoder

It is possible to set the position difference between the positioning encoder and a redundant encoder. To do this, the channel of the redundant position encoder must be specified in P 524[0] - ENC_EncRedPos and the maximum position tracking error must be specified, in increments, in P 597[0] - ENC_RedPos_DiffMax. Monitoring is not active if P 524[0] = 0 and the drive has been referenced. It is reset when the associated error is acknowledged or homing is executed again.

# 6.10 Axis correction

The position value delivered by the encoder system and the actual position value on the axis may vary for a number of reasons. Such non-linear inaccuracies can be compensated by axis error correction (using position- and direction-dependent correction values). For this, a correction value table is filled with values for each of the two directions. The respective correction value is produced from the current axis position and the direction of movement by means of cubic, jerk-stabilized interpolation. The position value is adapted on the basis of the corrected table.

# 6.9 Redundant encoder

It is possible to set the position difference between the positioning encoder and a redundant encoder. To do this, the channel of the redundant position encoder must be specified in P 524[0] - ENC_EncRedPos and the maximum position tracking error must be specified, in increments, in P 597[0] - ENC_RedPos_DiffMax. Monitoring is not active if P 524[0] = 0 and the drive has been referenced. It is reset when the associated error is acknowledged or homing is executed again.

# 6.10 Axis correction

The position value delivered by the encoder system and the actual position value on the axis may vary for a number of reasons. Such non-linear inaccuracies can be compensated by axis error correction (using position- and direction-dependent correction values). For this, a correction value table is filled with values for each of the two directions. The respective correction value is produced from the current axis position and the direction of movement by means of cubic, jerk-stabilized interpolation. The position value is adapted on the basis of the corrected table.

# 6.9 Redundant encoder

It is possible to set the position difference between the positioning encoder and a redundant encoder. To do this, the channel of the redundant position encoder must be specified in P 524[0] - ENC_EncRedPos and the maximum position tracking error must be specified, in increments, in P 597[0] - ENC_RedPos_DiffMax. Monitoring is not active if P 524[0] = 0 and the drive has been referenced. It is reset when the associated error is acknowledged or homing is executed again.

# 6.10 Axis correction

The position value delivered by the encoder system and the actual position value on the axis may vary for a number of reasons. Such non-linear inaccuracies can be compensated by axis error correction (using position- and direction-dependent correction values). For this, a correction value table is filled with values for each of the two directions. The respective correction value is produced from the current axis position and the direction of movement by means of cubic, jerk-stabilized interpolation. The position value is adapted on the basis of the corrected table.

The position value delivered by the encoder system and the actual position value on the axis may vary for a number of reasons. Such non-linear inaccuracies can be compensated by axis error correction (using position- and direction-dependent correction values). For this, a correction value table is filled with values for each of the two directions.
