With ‘start control’ in the speed control mode, the teaching (teaching routine) begins with a slow run: e.g. <= 1 rpm (at least one revolution of ‘learning’ travel).

With the control still operating (and a slow run), the teaching is then stopped by calling the calculation function once: with P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeachCon=CALC1(3) or with P 385[0] - CON_TCoggTeach- Con = CALC2(8). It ‘calculates’ the corresponding compensation table (which can be saved) from.
