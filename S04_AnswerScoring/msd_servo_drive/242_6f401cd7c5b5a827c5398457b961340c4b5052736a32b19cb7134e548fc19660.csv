- Please check your parameter set for implausible settings.
- Please set device to factory setting, restart, and see if the error occurs again.
- When reporting this error to your service partner, please include your device's parameter setting.
- Please check that the encoder offset is set properly.
- If auto commutation is used, re-view the auto commutation setting and test under all possible conditions.
- If torque mode is used, reduce torque, ensure external speed limitation, or increase speed control gain for stronger limitation.

# 11.6.51 Error 57: reserved

# 11.6.52 Error 58: HYDRAULIC, common error

# 11.6.52.1 Error 58-1 (emergency code 6100h)

Cause: Hydraulics, p2t: overload of hydraulic pump

Suggested steps:

- Please reduce the load.
- Hydraulics, cyclic processing: Error during the cyclic execution of the hydraulics.
- In any case look at init outputs in the message window of the Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5.

# 11.6.52.2 Error 58-2 (emergency code 6100h)

Cause: Hydraulics, tracking error monitoring: maximum tracking error exceeded

Suggested steps:

- Please check the parameterization.
- Hydraulics, cyclic processing: Error during the cyclic execution of the hydraulics.
- In any case look at init outputs in the message window of the Moog DRIVEADMINISTRATOR 5.

# 11.6.53 Error 60: Spindle clamping system monitoring error

# 11.6.53.1   Error 60-1 (emergency code 6100h)

# 11.6.55   Error 62: Battery buffered encoder

Cause: Tool not clamped correctly while in operation

# 11.6.55.1   Error 62-1 (emergency code 7305h)

Cause: Encoder channel 1: Endat22, Error 'M-ALL-Power-Down' (BAT)

# Suggested steps:

- Do not switch on drive while tool is not clamped correctly

# 11.6.53.2   Error 60-2 (emergency code 6100h)

Cause: Unknown combination of input signals

# Suggested steps:

Multiturn position is lost! Please perform a new homing of the drive. Please reset the encoder internal warnings and errors with parameters (642) and (644).

'M-ALL-Power-Down' (BAT)

- A sensor with implementation of the multi-turn part via battery buffer is connected.
- The error occurs when both voltages, on the one hand the normal encoder supply voltage and on the other hand the auxiliary battery voltage, had failed at the same time at the encoder.
- In this case, the multiturn part of the position is lost.

# 11.6.53.3   Error 60-3 (emergency code 6100h)

Cause: Clamping pressure was not applied properly

# Suggested steps:

- Check clamping pressure generation

# 11.6.54   Error 61: End damping error

# 11.6.54.1   Error 61-1 (emergency code 6100h)

Cause: End damping speed limitation error

# Suggested steps:

- Switch off/on device. Please contact your service provider if this error occurs again

Cause: Encoder channel 3: Endat22, Error 'M-ALL-Power-Down' (BAT)

Suggested steps:

- Multiturn position is lost! Please perform a new homing of the drive.
- Please reset the encoder internal warnings and errors with parameters (642) and (644).

'M-ALL-Power-Down' (BAT)

- A sensor with implementation of the multi-turn part via battery buffer is connected.
- The error occurs when both voltages, on the one hand the normal encoder supply voltage and on the other hand the auxiliary battery voltage, had failed at the same time at the encoder.
- In this case, the multiturn part of the position is lost.

# 11.6.56 Error 63: Error brake monitoring

# 11.6.56.1 Error 63-1 (emergency code 6100h)

Cause: Brake monitoring error, cannot reach target torque, brake remains closed

Suggested steps:

- Check torque or system limits, control settings or motor data set
- This is possibly a hardware issue
- If other measures fail to solve the problem, please replace the servo drive.
