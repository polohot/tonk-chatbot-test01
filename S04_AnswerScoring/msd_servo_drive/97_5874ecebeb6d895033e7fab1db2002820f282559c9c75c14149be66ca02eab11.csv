- If possible, reduce the needed current, especially in low-frequency range.
- If possible, lower the switching frequency or enable automatic frequency selection.
- Check if the encoder offset is set properly.
- Consider using an axis module with higher current rating.

This is possibly a hardware issue. If other measures fail to solve the problem, please replace the servo drive.
