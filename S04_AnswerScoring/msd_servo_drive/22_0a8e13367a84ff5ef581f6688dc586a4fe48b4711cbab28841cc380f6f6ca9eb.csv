- are the length of an analog Sin/Cos signal period in nanometres and the length of a digital increment of the position from the absolute value interface in nanometres. Both parameters are used for linear EnDat encoders and linear HIPERFACE encoders (instead of MultiT and SingleT bits (rotary)). In contrast, linear SSI encoders are treated as rotary SSI encoders (in this case, it is impossible to determine that the system is a linear encoder system based on the encoder head). Likewise, linear Sin/Cos encoders without an absolute value interface are treated as “rotary” encoders (if run as commutation encoders, the number of tracks, or lines (Lines) and the encoder gearing (Num, Denom) must be used to establish the relationship to the linear motor’s magn. pole pair subdivision). Only in the case of Sin/Cos encoders with distance-coded reference marks will the system determine, based on PeriodLen > 0, that the encoder system is linear and not rotary.

By default, CycleCount = 1, i.e. the default setting corresponds to 125 μs sampling and cycles for the encoder evaluation. Different settings must be viewed as special cases and accordingly must only be used when necessary. (see Section ""SSI (cyclical) X7"" on page 69).

For example, if you were using the Heidenhain ROD280C with 18000 Sin/Cos tracks per revolution and 36 distance-coded reference marks, you would need to set NominalIncrementA to 1000 signal periods and NominalIncrementB to 1001 signal periods.
