Encoder signal oversampling optimizes the accuracy of resolver and Sin/Cos signals. This function can only be used, if necessary, for low-track Sin/Cos encoders and resolvers; using it for high-track Sin/Cos encoders is not permissible.

# 6.12 Multi-turn encoder as a single-turn encoder

By way of parameters P 548[0] - ENC_CH1_MTEnable = 1 (for Channel 1) and P 585[0] - ENC_CH3_MTEnable = 1 (for Channel 3) a multi-turn encoder can be run as a single-turn encoder. This function is used primarily for testing purposes.

Parameterization is carried out in the selected user unit for the position as integer values. It is advisable to use the same number of correction interpolation points for the positive and negative directions. The first and last correction values in the table must be zero in order to avoid instability (step changes) of the actual position value. Differing correction values for the positive and negative directions at the same interpolation point will lead to instability in the associated actual position value when the direction is reversed, and so possibly to a step response adjustment to the reference position.
