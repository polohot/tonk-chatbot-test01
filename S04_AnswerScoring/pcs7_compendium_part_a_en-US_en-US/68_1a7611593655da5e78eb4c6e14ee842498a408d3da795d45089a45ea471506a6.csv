You need to configure how the outputs are to respond to a CPU STOP. In this example, the outputs have no current or voltage (OCV setting).

Note

You must set the channel-specific setting ""Reaction to CPU STOP"" (OCV - No Output Current or Voltage, KLV - Keep Last Value and USV - Use Substitute Value) of a module (e.g. analog output with 4 channels) the same for all channels within the ET 200M distributed I/O.

Process image partition (PIP)

Assign the process image partition to an I/O module you have previously defined in the CPU properties for a cyclic interrupt OB (see the section titled ""Assigning parameters for process image partitions""). This step synchronizes the I/O values or signals of this module with the process image in the CPU before and after the cyclic interrupt OB.

To do this, open the properties of the module and the ""Addresses"" tab and set the desired process image partition (TPA1 in this case). The process image partition is therefore assigned for all I/O values or signals of this module.

Note

It is generally practical to initially assign all modules to a medium program cycle (e.g. 500 ms or 1,000 ms) for a complete process consisting of a few fast and slow parts. Then, you only assign the appropriate process image partition of the cyclic interrupt involved to the modules containing the signals for fast control loops or interlocks (e.g. 50 ms or 100 ms).

Assign the process image partition to an I/O module you have previously defined in the CPU properties for a cyclic interrupt OB (see the section titled ""Assigning parameters for process image partitions""). This step synchronizes the I/O values or signals of this module with the process image in the CPU before and after the cyclic interrupt OB.

To do this, open the properties of the module and the ""Addresses"" tab and set the desired process image partition (TPA1 in this case). The process image partition is therefore assigned for all I/O values or signals of this module.

Note

It is generally practical to initially assign all modules to a medium program cycle (e.g. 500 ms or 1,000 ms) for a complete process consisting of a few fast and slow parts. Then, you only assign the appropriate process image partition of the cyclic interrupt involved to the modules containing the signals for fast control loops or interlocks (e.g. 50 ms or 100 ms).

# 6.6 Configuration of the I/O devices

Process image partition (PIP)

Assign the process image partition to an I/O module you have previously defined in the CPU properties for a cyclic interrupt OB (see the section titled ""Assigning parameters for process image partitions""). This step synchronizes the I/O values or signals of this module with the process image in the CPU before and after the cyclic interrupt OB.

To do this, open the properties of the module and the ""Addresses"" tab and set the desired process image partition (TPA1 in this case). The process image partition is therefore assigned for all I/O values or signals of this module.

Note

It is generally practical to initially assign all modules to a medium program cycle (e.g. 500 ms or 1,000 ms) for a complete process consisting of a few fast and slow parts. Then, you only assign the appropriate process image partition of the cyclic interrupt involved to the modules containing the signals for fast control loops or interlocks (e.g. 50 ms or 100 ms).

You need to configure how the outputs are to respond to a CPU STOP. In this example, the outputs have no current or voltage (OCV setting).

Note

You must set the channel-specific setting ""Reaction to CPU STOP"" (OCV - No Output Current or Voltage, KLV - Keep Last Value and USV - Use Substitute Value) of a module (e.g. analog output with 4 channels) the same for all channels within the ET 200M distributed I/O.

Process image partition (PIP)

Assign the process image partition to an I/O module you have previously defined in the CPU properties for a cyclic interrupt OB (see the section titled ""Assigning parameters for process image partitions""). This step synchronizes the I/O values or signals of this module with the process image in the CPU before and after the cyclic interrupt OB.

To do this, open the properties of the module and the ""Addresses"" tab and set the desired process image partition (TPA1 in this case). The process image partition is therefore assigned for all I/O values or signals of this module.

Note

It is generally practical to initially assign all modules to a medium program cycle (e.g. 500 ms or 1,000 ms) for a complete process consisting of a few fast and slow parts. Then, you only assign the appropriate process image partition of the cyclic interrupt involved to the modules containing the signals for fast control loops or interlocks (e.g. 50 ms or 100 ms).

You need to configure how the outputs are to respond to a CPU STOP. In this example, the outputs have no current or voltage (OCV setting).

Note

You must set the channel-specific setting ""Reaction to CPU STOP"" (OCV - No Output Current or Voltage, KLV - Keep Last Value and USV - Use Substitute Value) of a module (e.g. analog output with 4 channels) the same for all channels within the ET 200M distributed I/O.

# 6.6 Configuration of the I/O devices

Process image partition (PIP)

Assign the process image partition to an I/O module you have previously defined in the CPU properties for a cyclic interrupt OB (see the section titled ""Assigning parameters for process image partitions""). This step synchronizes the I/O values or signals of this module with the process image in the CPU before and after the cyclic interrupt OB.

To do this, open the properties of the module and the ""Addresses"" tab and set the desired process image partition (TPA1 in this case). The process image partition is therefore assigned for all I/O values or signals of this module.

Note

It is generally practical to initially assign all modules to a medium program cycle (e.g. 500 ms or 1,000 ms) for a complete process consisting of a few fast and slow parts. Then, you only assign the appropriate process image partition of the cyclic interrupt involved to the modules containing the signals for fast control loops or interlocks (e.g. 50 ms or 100 ms).
