Setting the transmission rate and operating mode in the network

Siemens devices, including Industrial Ethernet switches (SCALANCE X) and the Industrial Ethernet CPs (CP 443-1 as of version 1EX10) are factory set for automatic detection of the parameters for transmission rate and operating mode (autosensing, autonegotiation).

Autosensing describes the property of network components to automatically interpret an incoming transmission signal.

However, their use may result in significantly reduced performance in some situations. Office must not be used in process mode on any other operator stations and BATCH stations.

# Introduction

PCS 7 software is installed automatically via a PCS 7 framework setup. You can find extensive information on this in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 - PC Configuration"" manual. If the installation of a computer is to be performed manually, the necessary prerequisites for the installation and the installation procedure must be observed.

Setting the transmission rate and operating mode in the network

Siemens devices, including Industrial Ethernet switches (SCALANCE X) and the Industrial Ethernet CPs (CP 443-1 as of version 1EX10) are factory set for automatic detection of the parameters for transmission rate and operating mode (autosensing, autonegotiation).

Autosensing describes the property of network components to automatically interpret an incoming transmission signal.

However, their use may result in significantly reduced performance in some situations. Office must not be used in process mode on any other operator stations and BATCH stations. The user bears sole responsibility when third-party products are used. If you require third-party products, these should be installed before you install PCS 7. PCS 7 and third-party products must not be active at the same time.

# Network security (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Install a virus scanner solution for the terminal bus and supply this with current patterns. Only install software approved by Siemens on all stations with process mode.

# 4.3.4 Installation of PCS 7

# Introduction

PCS 7 software is installed automatically via a PCS 7 framework setup. You can find extensive information on this in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 - PC Configuration"" manual. If the installation of a computer is to be performed manually, the necessary prerequisites for the installation and the installation procedure must be observed. You can find information about this in the ""PCS 7 Readme V9.0"" documentation and in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 - PC Configuration"" manual.

Address management

Following the PCS 7 installation, check the addresses and make any settings which may be required. Systematic assignment of the addresses at the start of the project will make configuration, commissioning, plant expansion, and maintenance easier. Record the assigned addresses in a table like the one shown below, for example, and keep them up to date:
