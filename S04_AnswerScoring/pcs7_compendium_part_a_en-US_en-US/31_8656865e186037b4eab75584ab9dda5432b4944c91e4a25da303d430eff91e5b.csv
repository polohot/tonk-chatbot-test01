The characters [ ‘ ] [ ' ] [ . ] [ % ] [ \ ] [ * ] [ ? ] [ : ] [ space ] within a name are converted into the substitute character [ $ ] when compiling the OS. The ES separator [ \ ] is converted to the [ / ] character.

# Example

If, for example, you assign the name ""TICA:1"" for a CFC chart (this becomes ""TICA$1"" on the OS) and use the name ""TICA*1"" for another CFC chart, (also becomes ""TICA$1""), you will receive an error message with the OS compilation of the second chart because the chart name already exists.
