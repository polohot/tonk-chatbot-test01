# Configuring AS functions

# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

# 8.2.4 Run sequence

Principle of the run sequence

A runtime group is created for every CFC chart (process tag) automatically upon creation. The ""Predecessor for runtime sequence"" function in the runtime editor provides the option of determining the installation position of the next CFC chart within a cyclic interrupt OB. All blocks of a CFC chart are therefore assigned to the same cyclic interrupt OB. This ensures that the channel drivers and technological blocks are processed in the same cycle in a runtime sequence.

Note
If blocks with startup characteristics are included, these are also integrated in OB 100.

Principle of the run sequence

A runtime group is created for every CFC chart (process tag) automatically upon creation. The ""Predecessor for runtime sequence"" function in the runtime editor provides the option of determining the installation position of the next CFC chart within a cyclic interrupt OB. All blocks of a CFC chart are therefore assigned to the same cyclic interrupt OB. This ensures that the channel drivers and technological blocks are processed in the same cycle in a runtime sequence.

Note
If blocks with startup characteristics are included, these are also integrated in OB 100.

Principle of the run sequence

A runtime group is created for every CFC chart (process tag) automatically upon creation. The ""Predecessor for runtime sequence"" function in the runtime editor provides the option of determining the installation position of the next CFC chart within a cyclic interrupt OB. All blocks of a CFC chart are therefore assigned to the same cyclic interrupt OB. This ensures that the channel drivers and technological blocks are processed in the same cycle in a runtime sequence.

Note
If blocks with startup characteristics are included, these are also integrated in OB 100.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

# 8.2.4 Run sequence

Principle of the run sequence

A runtime group is created for every CFC chart (process tag) automatically upon creation. The ""Predecessor for runtime sequence"" function in the runtime editor provides the option of determining the installation position of the next CFC chart within a cyclic interrupt OB. All blocks of a CFC chart are therefore assigned to the same cyclic interrupt OB. This ensures that the channel drivers and technological blocks are processed in the same cycle in a runtime sequence.

Note
If blocks with startup characteristics are included, these are also integrated in OB 100.
