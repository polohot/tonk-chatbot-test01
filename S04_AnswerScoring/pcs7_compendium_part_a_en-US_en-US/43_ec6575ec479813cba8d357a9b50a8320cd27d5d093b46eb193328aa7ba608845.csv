# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.5 Adding Additional Stations

# 5.5.4 OS clients

# Introduction

By creating the stations in the project ""20_OS"" an OS client station has already been created which was renamed to ""CLIENT01"" in the previous section. This OS client can be configured and started accordingly in the later configuration stages. Furthermore the connection to OS servers already activated can also be tested. The OS clients for the plant operator are created later once the configuration is complete in the separate project ""21_CL"".

# Procedure

The following steps demonstrate how to create the station ""CLIENT02"":

1. Copy the completed station ""CLIENT01"" from project ""20_OS"" to project ""21_CL"" and rename it to ""CLIENT02"".

# 5.5.4 OS clients

# Introduction

By creating the stations in the project ""20_OS"" an OS client station has already been created which was renamed to ""CLIENT01"" in the previous section. This OS client can be configured and started accordingly in the later configuration stages. Furthermore the connection to OS servers already activated can also be tested. The OS clients for the plant operator are created later once the configuration is complete in the separate project ""21_CL"".

# Procedure

The following steps demonstrate how to create the station ""CLIENT02"":

1. Copy the completed station ""CLIENT01"" from project ""20_OS"" to project ""21_CL"" and rename it to ""CLIENT02"".
2. Rename the OS client project in the SIMATIC Manager as ""CL02"".

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.5 Adding Additional Stations

# 5.5.4 OS clients

# Introduction

By creating the stations in the project ""20_OS"" an OS client station has already been created which was renamed to ""CLIENT01"" in the previous section. This OS client can be configured and started accordingly in the later configuration stages. Furthermore the connection to OS servers already activated can also be tested. The OS clients for the plant operator are created later once the configuration is complete in the separate project ""21_CL"".

# Procedure

The following steps demonstrate how to create the station ""CLIENT02"":

1. Copy the completed station ""CLIENT01"" from project ""20_OS"" to project ""21_CL"" and rename it to ""CLIENT02"".
