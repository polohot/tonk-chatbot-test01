# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

Note

The diagnostic blocks from the charts (@Charts) are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Basis Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual in the “Family: @System” section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Advanced Process Library are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Advanced Process Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482346) manual in the ""Channel Blocks"" section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Library V7.1 are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Standard Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/36201733) function manual in the ""Family: DRIVER"" section.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

Current memory utilization for the work memory and the load memory can be ascertained in the online module status of the CPU. The warning threshold for the work memory and the load memory is 90% by default. This threshold can be changed in the CFC Editor.

Note

When changes are downloaded frequently, it is recommended that the assigned work memory code not exceed 80%. Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements: The assigned work memory code must not exceed 80%.

# Communication utilization

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
- The volume to be transferred is calculated by adding all AS-wide interconnections of a CPU in bytes per second. The maximum possible volume that can be transferred varies depending on the CPU and its performance. This figure should not be exceeded.

- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
- The volume to be transferred is calculated by adding all AS-wide interconnections of a CPU in bytes per second. The maximum possible volume that can be transferred varies depending on the CPU and its performance. This figure should not be exceeded.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

Note

The diagnostic blocks from the charts (@Charts) are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Basis Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual in the “Family: @System” section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Advanced Process Library are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Advanced Process Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482346) manual in the ""Channel Blocks"" section.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

# Communication utilization

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
- The volume to be transferred is calculated by adding all AS-wide interconnections of a CPU in bytes per second. The maximum possible volume that can be transferred varies depending on the CPU and its performance. This figure should not be exceeded.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

Note

The diagnostic blocks from the charts (@Charts) are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Basis Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual in the “Family: @System” section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Advanced Process Library are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Advanced Process Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482346) manual in the ""Channel Blocks"" section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Library V7.1 are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Standard Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/36201733) function manual in the ""Family: DRIVER"" section.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

# Communication utilization

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
- The volume to be transferred is calculated by adding all AS-wide interconnections of a CPU in bytes per second. The maximum possible volume that can be transferred varies depending on the CPU and its performance. This figure should not be exceeded.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

# Communication utilization

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
- The volume to be transferred is calculated by adding all AS-wide interconnections of a CPU in bytes per second. The maximum possible volume that can be transferred varies depending on the CPU and its performance. This figure should not be exceeded.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

Note

The diagnostic blocks from the charts (@Charts) are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Basis Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual in the “Family: @System” section.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

Note

The diagnostic blocks from the charts (@Charts) are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Basis Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual in the “Family: @System” section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Advanced Process Library are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Advanced Process Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482346) manual in the ""Channel Blocks"" section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Library V7.1 are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Standard Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/36201733) function manual in the ""Family: DRIVER"" section.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

Note

You can find additional information on ""CPU_RT"" in the ""Family: @System"" section of the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Basic Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

# Memory load

Current memory utilization for the work memory and the load memory can be ascertained in the online module status of the CPU. The warning threshold for the work memory and the load memory is 90% by default. This threshold can be changed in the CFC Editor.

Note

When changes are downloaded frequently, it is recommended that the assigned work memory code not exceed 80%. Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements: The assigned work memory code must not exceed 80%.

# Communication utilization

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
- The volume to be transferred is calculated by adding all AS-wide interconnections of a CPU in bytes per second. The maximum possible volume that can be transferred varies depending on the CPU and its performance. This figure should not be exceeded.

This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
- The volume to be transferred is calculated by adding all AS-wide interconnections of a CPU in bytes per second. The maximum possible volume that can be transferred varies depending on the CPU and its performance. This figure should not be exceeded.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

Note

The diagnostic blocks from the charts (@Charts) are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Basis Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual in the “Family: @System” section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Advanced Process Library are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Advanced Process Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482346) manual in the ""Channel Blocks"" section.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
- The volume to be transferred is calculated by adding all AS-wide interconnections of a CPU in bytes per second. The maximum possible volume that can be transferred varies depending on the CPU and its performance. This figure should not be exceeded.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

Note

The diagnostic blocks from the charts (@Charts) are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Basis Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual in the “Family: @System” section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Advanced Process Library are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Advanced Process Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482346) manual in the ""Channel Blocks"" section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Library V7.1 are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Standard Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/36201733) function manual in the ""Family: DRIVER"" section.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

# Communication utilization

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
- The volume to be transferred is calculated by adding all AS-wide interconnections of a CPU in bytes per second. The maximum possible volume that can be transferred varies depending on the CPU and its performance. This figure should not be exceeded.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

Note

The diagnostic blocks from the charts (@Charts) are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Basis Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual in the “Family: @System” section.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

Note

The diagnostic blocks from the charts (@Charts) are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Basis Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual in the “Family: @System” section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Advanced Process Library are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Advanced Process Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482346) manual in the ""Channel Blocks"" section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Library V7.1 are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Standard Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/36201733) function manual in the ""Family: DRIVER"" section.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

# Communication utilization

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
- The volume to be transferred is calculated by adding all AS-wide interconnections of a CPU in bytes per second. The maximum possible volume that can be transferred varies depending on the CPU and its performance. This figure should not be exceeded.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

Note

The diagnostic blocks from the charts (@Charts) are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Basis Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual in the “Family: @System” section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Advanced Process Library are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Advanced Process Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482346) manual in the ""Channel Blocks"" section.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

# Communication utilization

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
- The volume to be transferred is calculated by adding all AS-wide interconnections of a CPU in bytes per second. The maximum possible volume that can be transferred varies depending on the CPU and its performance. This figure should not be exceeded.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

Note

The diagnostic blocks from the charts (@Charts) are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Basis Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual in the “Family: @System” section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Advanced Process Library are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Advanced Process Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482346) manual in the ""Channel Blocks"" section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Library V7.1 are described in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Standard Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/36201733) function manual in the ""Family: DRIVER"" section.

# Diagnostic block ""CPU_RT""

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The ""CPU_RT"" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the ""Integrated asset management (Page 310)"" section).

Note

You can find additional information on ""CPU_RT"" in the ""Family: @System"" section of the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Basic Library"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the ""CPU_RT"" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the ""Driver concept (Page 176)"" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the ""CPU_RT"" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the ""Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit"" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

""Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)"".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

# Communication utilization

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
