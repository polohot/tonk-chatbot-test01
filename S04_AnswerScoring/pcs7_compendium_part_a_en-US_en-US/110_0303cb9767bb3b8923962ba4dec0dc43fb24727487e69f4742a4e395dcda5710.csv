# 12.1 Overview

PCS 7 diagnostics and maintenance functions enable you to monitor the various components of a PCS 7 plant and to display its status in process mode. This status is represented by defined icons.

A maintenance station (MS) must be configured in order to make use of these diagnostics and maintenance functions. The basis of an MS is always an OS that provides additional maintenance functions. The maintenance station can be operated as a single station system or as a server in a server-client architecture.

The MS server performs the following basic tasks:

- Provides the diagnostic area with pictures
- Monitoring of all AS components (CPU, distributed I/O, field devices)
- Monitoring of the network components and PC stations
- Monitoring of user-specific devices (with AssetM blocks)

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# 12.2.1 Characteristics for the MS server

The following characteristics apply for the MS server:

- Maintenance Station Standard (integrated in PCS7)
- Licenses required
- Full functionality
- Maintenance Station Basis (integrated in PCS7)
- No licenses required
- Only overview images for CPU objects, PC objects, and network components
- Detailed information cannot be called up (e.g. image blocks)
- Maintenance Station PDM (Stand-alone)
- With special software and hardware bundle only
- Parameter assignment and monitoring of field devices
- Monitoring of PC objects and network objects (optional)

# Integrated asset management

# 12.1 Overview

PCS 7 diagnostics and maintenance functions enable you to monitor the various components of a PCS 7 plant and to display its status in process mode. This status is represented by defined icons.

A maintenance station (MS) must be configured in order to make use of these diagnostics and maintenance functions. The basis of an MS is always an OS that provides additional maintenance functions. The maintenance station can be operated as a single station system or as a server in a server-client architecture.

The MS server performs the following basic tasks:

- Provides the diagnostic area with pictures
- Monitoring of all AS components (CPU, distributed I/O, field devices)
- Monitoring of the network components and PC stations
- Monitoring of user-specific devices (with AssetM blocks)

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# 12.2.1 Characteristics for the MS server

The following characteristics apply for the MS server:

- Maintenance Station Standard (integrated in PCS7)
- Licenses required
- Full functionality
- Maintenance Station Basis (integrated in PCS7)
- No licenses required
- Only overview images for CPU objects, PC objects, and network components
- Detailed information cannot be called up (e.g. image blocks)
- Maintenance Station PDM (Stand-alone)
- With special software and hardware bundle only
- Parameter assignment and monitoring of field devices
- Monitoring of PC objects and network objects (optional)

# Integrated asset management

# 12.1 Overview

PCS 7 diagnostics and maintenance functions enable you to monitor the various components of a PCS 7 plant and to display its status in process mode. This status is represented by defined icons.

A maintenance station (MS) must be configured in order to make use of these diagnostics and maintenance functions. The basis of an MS is always an OS that provides additional maintenance functions. The maintenance station can be operated as a single station system or as a server in a server-client architecture.

The MS server performs the following basic tasks:

- Provides the diagnostic area with pictures
- Monitoring of all AS components (CPU, distributed I/O, field devices)
- Monitoring of the network components and PC stations
- Monitoring of user-specific devices (with AssetM blocks)

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# 12.2.1 Characteristics for the MS server

The following characteristics apply for the MS server:

- Maintenance Station Standard (integrated in PCS7)
- Licenses required
- Full functionality
- Maintenance Station Basis (integrated in PCS7)
- No licenses required
- Only overview images for CPU objects, PC objects, and network components
- Detailed information cannot be called up (e.g. image blocks)
- Maintenance Station PDM (Stand-alone)
- With special software and hardware bundle only
- Parameter assignment and monitoring of field devices
- Monitoring of PC objects and network objects (optional)

The MS server can be installed on an existing OS server or on a separate computer depending on the size of the plant. The MS server can be configured redundantly. You can provide one MS server for each multiproject. All components in the multiproject is monitored by this server.

- Network card with TCP/IP connection to the plant bus for monitoring via SNMP

Note

Starting with SIMATIC PDM V8.2, SIMATIC PDM is accessed via a PDM Web server in connection with PCS 7. This enables access to a selected field device from any OS client.

# Integrated asset management

# 12.1 Overview

PCS 7 diagnostics and maintenance functions enable you to monitor the various components of a PCS 7 plant and to display its status in process mode. This status is represented by defined icons.

A maintenance station (MS) must be configured in order to make use of these diagnostics and maintenance functions. The basis of an MS is always an OS that provides additional maintenance functions. The maintenance station can be operated as a single station system or as a server in a server-client architecture.

The MS server performs the following basic tasks:

- Provides the diagnostic area with pictures
- Monitoring of all AS components (CPU, distributed I/O, field devices)
- Monitoring of the network components and PC stations
- Monitoring of user-specific devices (with AssetM blocks)

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# 12.2.1 Characteristics for the MS server

The following characteristics apply for the MS server:

- Maintenance Station Standard (integrated in PCS7)
- Licenses required
- Full functionality
- Maintenance Station Basis (integrated in PCS7)
- No licenses required
- Only overview images for CPU objects, PC objects, and network components
- Detailed information cannot be called up (e.g. image blocks)
- Maintenance Station PDM (Stand-alone)
- With special software and hardware bundle only
- Parameter assignment and monitoring of field devices
- Monitoring of PC objects and network objects (optional)

- Optional: Up to six non-redundant OS single-station systems (as reference OS of the OS single-station system)
- Maintenance Station (MS) as separate PC station

The MS server obtains the data from the automation systems via the redundant OS single-station system. If the redundant OS single-station system is deactivated, the data of the automation systems is no longer displayed. For the display of diagnostic information on the OS single-station systems, a Web server must be configured on the MS server.

The MS client runs directly on the master ES. The current multiproject is stored here. The MS server can be installed on an existing OS server or on a separate computer depending on the size of the plant. The MS server can be configured redundantly. You can provide one MS server for each multiproject. All components in the multiproject is monitored by this server.

- Network card with TCP/IP connection to the plant bus for monitoring via SNMP

Note

Starting with SIMATIC PDM V8.2, SIMATIC PDM is accessed via a PDM Web server in connection with PCS 7. This enables access to a selected field device from any OS client.

# Integrated asset management

# 12.1 Overview

PCS 7 diagnostics and maintenance functions enable you to monitor the various components of a PCS 7 plant and to display its status in process mode. This status is represented by defined icons.

A maintenance station (MS) must be configured in order to make use of these diagnostics and maintenance functions. The basis of an MS is always an OS that provides additional maintenance functions. The maintenance station can be operated as a single station system or as a server in a server-client architecture.

The MS server performs the following basic tasks:

- Provides the diagnostic area with pictures
- Monitoring of all AS components (CPU, distributed I/O, field devices)
- Monitoring of the network components and PC stations
- Monitoring of user-specific devices (with AssetM blocks)

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# 12.2.1 Characteristics for the MS server

The following characteristics apply for the MS server:

- Maintenance Station Standard (integrated in PCS7)
- Licenses required
- Full functionality
- Maintenance Station Basis (integrated in PCS7)
- No licenses required
- Only overview images for CPU objects, PC objects, and network components
- Detailed information cannot be called up (e.g. image blocks)
- Maintenance Station PDM (Stand-alone)
- With special software and hardware bundle only
- Parameter assignment and monitoring of field devices
- Monitoring of PC objects and network objects (optional)

The MS server can be installed on an existing OS server or on a separate computer depending on the size of the plant. The MS server can be configured redundantly. You can provide one MS server for each multiproject. All components in the multiproject is monitored by this server.

- Network card with TCP/IP connection to the plant bus for monitoring via SNMP

Note

Starting with SIMATIC PDM V8.2, SIMATIC PDM is accessed via a PDM Web server in connection with PCS 7. This enables access to a selected field device from any OS client.

# Integrated asset management

# 12.1 Overview

PCS 7 diagnostics and maintenance functions enable you to monitor the various components of a PCS 7 plant and to display its status in process mode. This status is represented by defined icons.

A maintenance station (MS) must be configured in order to make use of these diagnostics and maintenance functions. The basis of an MS is always an OS that provides additional maintenance functions. The maintenance station can be operated as a single station system or as a server in a server-client architecture.

The MS server performs the following basic tasks:

- Provides the diagnostic area with pictures
- Monitoring of all AS components (CPU, distributed I/O, field devices)
- Monitoring of the network components and PC stations
- Monitoring of user-specific devices (with AssetM blocks)

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# 12.2.1 Characteristics for the MS server

The following characteristics apply for the MS server:

- Maintenance Station Standard (integrated in PCS7)
- Licenses required
- Full functionality
- Maintenance Station Basis (integrated in PCS7)
- No licenses required
- Only overview images for CPU objects, PC objects, and network components
- Detailed information cannot be called up (e.g. image blocks)
- Maintenance Station PDM (Stand-alone)
- With special software and hardware bundle only
- Parameter assignment and monitoring of field devices
- Monitoring of PC objects and network objects (optional)

# Integrated asset management

# 12.1 Overview

PCS 7 diagnostics and maintenance functions enable you to monitor the various components of a PCS 7 plant and to display its status in process mode. This status is represented by defined icons.

A maintenance station (MS) must be configured in order to make use of these diagnostics and maintenance functions. The basis of an MS is always an OS that provides additional maintenance functions. The maintenance station can be operated as a single station system or as a server in a server-client architecture.

The MS server performs the following basic tasks:

- Provides the diagnostic area with pictures
- Monitoring of all AS components (CPU, distributed I/O, field devices)
- Monitoring of the network components and PC stations
- Monitoring of user-specific devices (with AssetM blocks)

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# 12.2.1 Characteristics for the MS server

The following characteristics apply for the MS server:

- Maintenance Station Standard (integrated in PCS7)
- Licenses required
- Full functionality
- Maintenance Station Basis (integrated in PCS7)
- No licenses required
- Only overview images for CPU objects, PC objects, and network components
- Detailed information cannot be called up (e.g. image blocks)
- Maintenance Station PDM (Stand-alone)
- With special software and hardware bundle only
- Parameter assignment and monitoring of field devices
- Monitoring of PC objects and network objects (optional)

# Integrated asset management

# 12.1 Overview

PCS 7 diagnostics and maintenance functions enable you to monitor the various components of a PCS 7 plant and to display its status in process mode. This status is represented by defined icons.

A maintenance station (MS) must be configured in order to make use of these diagnostics and maintenance functions. The basis of an MS is always an OS that provides additional maintenance functions. The maintenance station can be operated as a single station system or as a server in a server-client architecture.

The MS server performs the following basic tasks:

- Provides the diagnostic area with pictures
- Monitoring of all AS components (CPU, distributed I/O, field devices)
- Monitoring of the network components and PC stations
- Monitoring of user-specific devices (with AssetM blocks)

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# 12.2.1 Characteristics for the MS server

The following characteristics apply for the MS server:

- Maintenance Station Standard (integrated in PCS7)
- Licenses required
- Full functionality
- Maintenance Station Basis (integrated in PCS7)
- No licenses required
- Only overview images for CPU objects, PC objects, and network components
- Detailed information cannot be called up (e.g. image blocks)
- Maintenance Station PDM (Stand-alone)
- With special software and hardware bundle only
- Parameter assignment and monitoring of field devices
- Monitoring of PC objects and network objects (optional)

# Integrated asset management

# 12.1 Overview

PCS 7 diagnostics and maintenance functions enable you to monitor the various components of a PCS 7 plant and to display its status in process mode. This status is represented by defined icons.

A maintenance station (MS) must be configured in order to make use of these diagnostics and maintenance functions. The basis of an MS is always an OS that provides additional maintenance functions. The maintenance station can be operated as a single station system or as a server in a server-client architecture.

The MS server performs the following basic tasks:

- Provides the diagnostic area with pictures
- Monitoring of all AS components (CPU, distributed I/O, field devices)
- Monitoring of the network components and PC stations
- Monitoring of user-specific devices (with AssetM blocks)

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# 12.2.1 Characteristics for the MS server

The following characteristics apply for the MS server:

- Maintenance Station Standard (integrated in PCS7)
- Licenses required
- Full functionality
- Maintenance Station Basis (integrated in PCS7)
- No licenses required
- Only overview images for CPU objects, PC objects, and network components
- Detailed information cannot be called up (e.g. image blocks)
- Maintenance Station PDM (Stand-alone)
- With special software and hardware bundle only
- Parameter assignment and monitoring of field devices
- Monitoring of PC objects and network objects (optional)

# 12.2.3 Maintenance Station in flat hierarchies

Starting with PCS 7 V9.0, a Maintenance Station can be used even when OS single user systems with the following configuration are used:

- One redundant OS single-station system (single-station system + single-station system standby)
- Optional: Up to six non-redundant OS single-station systems (as reference OS of the OS single-station system)
- Maintenance Station (MS) as separate PC station

The MS server obtains the data from the automation systems via the redundant OS single-station system. If the redundant OS single-station system is deactivated, the data of the automation systems is no longer displayed. For the display of diagnostic information on the OS single-station systems, a Web server must be configured on the MS server. The diagnostic screens of the MS server can be accessed from the OS single-station system via WebBrowser control.

Note

You can find additional information on configurations of the Maintenance Station in flat architectures in the ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Standard Architectures (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109751791)"" manual.

Introduction

The MS client runs directly on the master ES. The current multiproject is stored here. The MS server can be installed on an existing OS server or on a separate computer depending on the size of the plant. The MS server can be configured redundantly. You can provide one MS server for each multiproject. All components in the multiproject is monitored by this server.
