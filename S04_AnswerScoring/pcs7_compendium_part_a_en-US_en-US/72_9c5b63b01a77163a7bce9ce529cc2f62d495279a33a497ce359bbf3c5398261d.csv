Introduction

In PCS 7 V7.1 and above you can use the ""AS-wide interconnections between 2 charts"" function from different AS. This function automatically inserts the correct S7 connection between the relevant AS in NetPro.

The possible S7 connections and the characteristics resulting from these are described below.

Note

You will find additional information on AS-wide interconnections in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

Communication between two standard AS

An additional standard AS must be configured for this section in addition to the AS1 in project ""01_Plant_B"" or in the multiproject.

Note

Configuring an AS-OS connection for the ES is only required when the ""OS Simulation"" function is used on the ES. With ""OS simulation"" you can test functions of the OS server project such as pictures or scripts on the ES before loading them to the OS server. In order to be able to use this simulation function, it is essential that the ES-AS connection has the same name as the OS-AS connection.

Note

The connections that lead from the two OS servers (as well as the ES) to the same automation system must have the same name, e.g. ""AS1"".

Introduction

In PCS 7 V7.1 and above you can use the ""AS-wide interconnections between 2 charts"" function from different AS. This function automatically inserts the correct S7 connection between the relevant AS in NetPro.

The possible S7 connections and the characteristics resulting from these are described below.

Note

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

The connections for SERVER1B are made in the same way as for AS1 and AS2.

Note

Configuring an AS-OS connection for the ES is only required when the ""OS Simulation"" function is used on the ES. With ""OS simulation"" you can test functions of the OS server project such as pictures or scripts on the ES before loading them to the OS server. In order to be able to use this simulation function, it is essential that the ES-AS connection has the same name as the OS-AS connection.

Note

The connections that lead from the two OS servers (as well as the ES) to the same automation system must have the same name, e.g. ""AS1"".

# 7.2.2 AS-OS communication

Introduction

In PCS 7 V7.1 and above you can use the ""AS-wide interconnections between 2 charts"" function from different AS. This function automatically inserts the correct S7 connection between the relevant AS in NetPro.

The possible S7 connections and the characteristics resulting from these are described below.

Note

You will find additional information on AS-wide interconnections in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

Communication between two standard AS

An additional standard AS must be configured for this section in addition to the AS1 in project ""01_Plant_B"" or in the multiproject.
