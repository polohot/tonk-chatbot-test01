The following steps demonstrate how to configure the plant bus:

1. If there is a network connection for CP16x3/CP16x8 in Windows, deactivate the ""Client for Microsoft Networks"" and ""File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks"" protocols in this network connection, as these two Microsoft protocols are only required at the plant bus.
2. Check the current configuration of your installed network cards with the ""communication settings"" tool (""Start > All programs > Siemens Automation > SIMATIC > SIMATIC NET > Communication settings""). The plant bus is generally configured via the SIMATIC Manager of your ES and is described in the ""Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)"" section.
3. Check that the MAC address and the TCP/IP addresses correspond with the planning.

# 4.3.9 License management

Introduction

A process for managing evidence of the existing licenses should be defined for all stages in the lifecycle of a PCS 7 plant. This management should cover all the licenses used in a plant. The following points must be taken into account:

- Storage location
- Person responsible
- Access
- Procedure when a license is lost or defective

The serial number of each individual license should be listed in addition to the description and article number so that the license documents can be clearly matched with the licenses that are installed.

Use a defined station, e.g. the ES, in order to manage all license packages ordered centrally with the ""Automation License Manager"" program.

# 4.3.9 License management

Introduction

A process for managing evidence of the existing licenses should be defined for all stages in the lifecycle of a PCS 7 plant. This management should cover all the licenses used in a plant. The following points must be taken into account:

- Storage location
- Person responsible
- Access
- Procedure when a license is lost or defective

The serial number of each individual license should be listed in addition to the description and article number so that the license documents can be clearly matched with the licenses that are installed.

Use a defined station, e.g. the ES, in order to manage all license packages ordered centrally with the ""Automation License Manager"" program.

Introduction

The following tasks should be executed as part of configuring the computer:

- Creating the users for logging onto Windows for ES and OS station with user rights and membership in the SIMATIC HMI group
- Adapting NTFS authorizations for the project directories

If SIMATIC Logon is being used, the following task should also be performed:

- Creating the user groups for SIMATIC Logon in accordance with the planned distribution of roles

# 4.3.9 License management

Introduction

A process for managing evidence of the existing licenses should be defined for all stages in the lifecycle of a PCS 7 plant. This management should cover all the licenses used in a plant. The following points must be taken into account:

- Storage location
- Person responsible
- Access
- Procedure when a license is lost or defective

The serial number of each individual license should be listed in addition to the description and article number so that the license documents can be clearly matched with the licenses that are installed.

Use a defined station, e.g. the ES, in order to manage all license packages ordered centrally with the ""Automation License Manager"" program.

2. Check the current configuration of your installed network cards with the ""communication settings"" tool (""Start > All programs > Siemens Automation > SIMATIC > SIMATIC NET > Communication settings""). The plant bus is generally configured via the SIMATIC Manager of your ES and is described in the ""Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)"" section.
3. Check that the MAC address and the TCP/IP addresses correspond with the planning.

1. If there is a network connection for CP16x3/CP16x8 in Windows, deactivate the ""Client for Microsoft Networks"" and ""File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks"" protocols in this network connection, as these two Microsoft protocols are only required at the plant bus.
2.

The following steps demonstrate how to configure the plant bus:

1. If there is a network connection for CP16x3/CP16x8 in Windows, deactivate the ""Client for Microsoft Networks"" and ""File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks"" protocols in this network connection, as these two Microsoft protocols are only required at the plant bus.
2. Check the current configuration of your installed network cards with the ""communication settings"" tool (""Start > All programs > Siemens Automation > SIMATIC > SIMATIC NET > Communication settings""). The plant bus is generally configured via the SIMATIC Manager of your ES and is described in the ""Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)"" section.
3. Check that the MAC address and the TCP/IP addresses correspond with the planning.

- Person responsible
- Access
- Procedure when a license is lost or defective

The serial number of each individual license should be listed in addition to the description and article number so that the license documents can be clearly matched with the licenses that are installed.

The following steps demonstrate how to configure the plant bus:

1. If there is a network connection for CP16x3/CP16x8 in Windows, deactivate the ""Client for Microsoft Networks"" and ""File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks"" protocols in this network connection, as these two Microsoft protocols are only required at the plant bus.
2. Check the current configuration of your installed network cards with the ""communication settings"" tool (""Start > All programs > Siemens Automation > SIMATIC > SIMATIC NET > Communication settings"").

- Person responsible
- Access
- Procedure when a license is lost or defective

The serial number of each individual license should be listed in addition to the description and article number so that the license documents can be clearly matched with the licenses that are installed.

# Preparation and administration

# 4.3 Installation Procedure

The following steps demonstrate how to configure the plant bus:

1. If there is a network connection for CP16x3/CP16x8 in Windows, deactivate the ""Client for Microsoft Networks"" and ""File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks"" protocols in this network connection, as these two Microsoft protocols are only required at the plant bus.
2. Check the current configuration of your installed network cards with the ""communication settings"" tool (""Start > All programs > Siemens Automation > SIMATIC > SIMATIC NET > Communication settings""). The plant bus is generally configured via the SIMATIC Manager of your ES and is described in the ""Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)"" section.
3. Check that the MAC address and the TCP/IP addresses correspond with the planning.

Note

You can find detailed information about configuring the ""Plant bus"" connection in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 - PC Configuration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.

# 4.3 Installation

# 4.3.8 Setting up users and assigning rights

Introduction

The following tasks should be executed as part of configuring the computer:

- Creating the users for logging onto Windows for ES and OS station with user rights and membership in the SIMATIC HMI group
- Adapting NTFS authorizations for the project directories

If SIMATIC Logon is being used, the following task should also be performed:

- Creating the user groups for SIMATIC Logon in accordance with the planned distribution of roles

Reference

You can find additional information on the topic of ""user rights"" in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 – PC Configuration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.

# 4.3.9 License management

Introduction

A process for managing evidence of the existing licenses should be defined for all stages in the lifecycle of a PCS 7 plant. This management should cover all the licenses used in a plant. The following points must be taken into account:

- Storage location
- Person responsible
- Access
- Procedure when a license is lost or defective

The serial number of each individual license should be listed in addition to the description and article number so that the license documents can be clearly matched with the licenses that are installed.

Use a defined station, e.g. the ES, in order to manage all license packages ordered centrally with the ""Automation License Manager"" program.
