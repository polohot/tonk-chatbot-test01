# Integration via the generic station description (GSD) as a standard slave

Field devices made by any manufacturer can be integrated via the standard GSD file
(standard slaves). This type of integration is used for PROFIBUS DP, PROFIBUS PA, FF
and HART devices. The configuration is set in HW Config. The default parameter
assignment for the device is also pre-defined in the GSD. Parameter adjustments must then
be made using a proprietary tool; alternatively, in the case of devices with EDD (Electronic
Device Description) the adaptations can be made using SIMATIC PDM.

Data can only be exchanged between the master and a field device if the master is aware of
the device-specific parameters and data formats. The field device manufacturer supplies this
""knowledge"" in the form of a GSD file.

GSD files contain information about:

- Device manufacturer and identification number
- Transmission rate and bus parameters
- Volume and format of data for cyclic communication

In HW Config in the object properties of a device you can determine which revision level of the GSD is installed and used. For this right-click on the device after positioning the device and select ""Object properties"" in the context menu.

For S7 slaves which are integrated via the object manager, no GSD file is specified here. You can occasionally procure a later GSD for a field device from the field device manufacturer. This GSD can be easily installed.

To install a GSD:

1. Open HW Config.

# Integration via the generic station description (GSD) as a standard slave

Field devices made by any manufacturer can be integrated via the standard GSD file
(standard slaves). This type of integration is used for PROFIBUS DP, PROFIBUS PA, FF
and HART devices. The configuration is set in HW Config. The default parameter
assignment for the device is also pre-defined in the GSD. Parameter adjustments must then
be made using a proprietary tool; alternatively, in the case of devices with EDD (Electronic
Device Description) the adaptations can be made using SIMATIC PDM.

Data can only be exchanged between the master and a field device if the master is aware of
the device-specific parameters and data formats. The field device manufacturer supplies this
""knowledge"" in the form of a GSD file.

GSD files contain information about:

- Device manufacturer and identification number
- Transmission rate and bus parameters
- Volume and format of data for cyclic communication

# Integration via the generic station description (GSD) as a standard slave

Field devices made by any manufacturer can be integrated via the standard GSD file
(standard slaves). This type of integration is used for PROFIBUS DP, PROFIBUS PA, FF
and HART devices. The configuration is set in HW Config. The default parameter
assignment for the device is also pre-defined in the GSD. Parameter adjustments must then
be made using a proprietary tool; alternatively, in the case of devices with EDD (Electronic
Device Description) the adaptations can be made using SIMATIC PDM.

Data can only be exchanged between the master and a field device if the master is aware of
the device-specific parameters and data formats. The field device manufacturer supplies this
""knowledge"" in the form of a GSD file.

GSD files contain information about:

- Device manufacturer and identification number
- Transmission rate and bus parameters
- Volume and format of data for cyclic communication

In HW Config in the object properties of a device you can determine which revision level of the GSD is installed and used. For this right-click on the device after positioning the device and select ""Object properties"" in the context menu.

For S7 slaves which are integrated via the object manager, no GSD file is specified here. You can occasionally procure a later GSD for a field device from the field device manufacturer. This GSD can be easily installed.
