Introduction

Implementation of the required automation functions is often possible with PCS 7 in various ways. The work steps described in this document for project creation, configuration and parameter assignment provide the basis for the PCS 7 application to be created. The following aspects play an important role in this for the complete runtime of the system:

- Availability

The availability of the overall system can be influenced by appropriate actions in the PCS 7 application starting in the planning phase.
- Expandability

Expansions and/or changes will need to be made repeatedly following the initial commissioning of a PCS 7 system. Attention must be paid to this when creating the PCS 7 application so that these can be executed more efficiently.
- Maintainability

According to the IEEE 610.12-1990 standard, software maintenance is understood to be ""the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment"".
- Legibility

Among other things, one of the principles of programming in IT theory is that the software must be created legibly. The requirements are that the code is well formatted, corresponding identifiers are used and meaningful comments are inserted.

The work steps described in this document for project creation, configuration and parameter assignment provide the basis for the PCS 7 application to be created. The following aspects play an important role in this for the complete runtime of the system:

- Availability

The availability of the overall system can be influenced by appropriate actions in the PCS 7 application starting in the planning phase.
- Expandability

Expansions and/or changes will need to be made repeatedly following the initial commissioning of a PCS 7 system. Attention must be paid to this when creating the PCS 7 application so that these can be executed more efficiently.
- Maintainability

According to the IEEE 610.12-1990 standard, software maintenance is understood to be ""the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment"".
- Legibility

Among other things, one of the principles of programming in IT theory is that the software must be created legibly. The requirements are that the code is well formatted, corresponding identifiers are used and meaningful comments are inserted.

Introduction

Implementation of the required automation functions is often possible with PCS 7 in various ways. The work steps described in this document for project creation, configuration and parameter assignment provide the basis for the PCS 7 application to be created. The following aspects play an important role in this for the complete runtime of the system:

- Availability

The availability of the overall system can be influenced by appropriate actions in the PCS 7 application starting in the planning phase.
- Expandability

Expansions and/or changes will need to be made repeatedly following the initial commissioning of a PCS 7 system. Attention must be paid to this when creating the PCS 7 application so that these can be executed more efficiently.
- Maintainability

According to the IEEE 610.12-1990 standard, software maintenance is understood to be ""the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment"".
- Legibility

Among other things, one of the principles of programming in IT theory is that the software must be created legibly. The requirements are that the code is well formatted, corresponding identifiers are used and meaningful comments are inserted.

Introduction

Implementation of the required automation functions is often possible with PCS 7 in various ways. The work steps described in this document for project creation, configuration and parameter assignment provide the basis for the PCS 7 application to be created. The following aspects play an important role in this for the complete runtime of the system:

- Availability

The availability of the overall system can be influenced by appropriate actions in the PCS 7 application starting in the planning phase.
- Expandability

Expansions and/or changes will need to be made repeatedly following the initial commissioning of a PCS 7 system. Attention must be paid to this when creating the PCS 7 application so that these can be executed more efficiently.
- Maintainability

According to the IEEE 610.12-1990 standard, software maintenance is understood to be ""the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment"".
- Legibility

Among other things, one of the principles of programming in IT theory is that the software must be created legibly. The requirements are that the code is well formatted, corresponding identifiers are used and meaningful comments are inserted.

Introduction

Implementation of the required automation functions is often possible with PCS 7 in various ways. The work steps described in this document for project creation, configuration and parameter assignment provide the basis for the PCS 7 application to be created. The following aspects play an important role in this for the complete runtime of the system:

- Availability

The availability of the overall system can be influenced by appropriate actions in the PCS 7 application starting in the planning phase.
- Expandability

Expansions and/or changes will need to be made repeatedly following the initial commissioning of a PCS 7 system. Attention must be paid to this when creating the PCS 7 application so that these can be executed more efficiently.
- Maintainability

According to the IEEE 610.12-1990 standard, software maintenance is understood to be ""the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment"".
- Legibility

Among other things, one of the principles of programming in IT theory is that the software must be created legibly. The requirements are that the code is well formatted, corresponding identifiers are used and meaningful comments are inserted.

Introduction

Implementation of the required automation functions is often possible with PCS 7 in various ways. The work steps described in this document for project creation, configuration and parameter assignment provide the basis for the PCS 7 application to be created. The following aspects play an important role in this for the complete runtime of the system:

- Availability

The availability of the overall system can be influenced by appropriate actions in the PCS 7 application starting in the planning phase.
- Expandability

Expansions and/or changes will need to be made repeatedly following the initial commissioning of a PCS 7 system. Attention must be paid to this when creating the PCS 7 application so that these can be executed more efficiently.
- Maintainability

According to the IEEE 610.12-1990 standard, software maintenance is understood to be ""the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment"".
- Legibility

Among other things, one of the principles of programming in IT theory is that the software must be created legibly. The requirements are that the code is well formatted, corresponding identifiers are used and meaningful comments are inserted.

Introduction

Implementation of the required automation functions is often possible with PCS 7 in various ways. The work steps described in this document for project creation, configuration and parameter assignment provide the basis for the PCS 7 application to be created. The following aspects play an important role in this for the complete runtime of the system:

- Availability

The availability of the overall system can be influenced by appropriate actions in the PCS 7 application starting in the planning phase.
- Expandability

Expansions and/or changes will need to be made repeatedly following the initial commissioning of a PCS 7 system. Attention must be paid to this when creating the PCS 7 application so that these can be executed more efficiently.
- Maintainability

According to the IEEE 610.12-1990 standard, software maintenance is understood to be ""the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment"".
- Legibility

Among other things, one of the principles of programming in IT theory is that the software must be created legibly. The requirements are that the code is well formatted, corresponding identifiers are used and meaningful comments are inserted.

Introduction

Implementation of the required automation functions is often possible with PCS 7 in various ways. The work steps described in this document for project creation, configuration and parameter assignment provide the basis for the PCS 7 application to be created. The following aspects play an important role in this for the complete runtime of the system:

- Availability

The availability of the overall system can be influenced by appropriate actions in the PCS 7 application starting in the planning phase.
- Expandability

Expansions and/or changes will need to be made repeatedly following the initial commissioning of a PCS 7 system. Attention must be paid to this when creating the PCS 7 application so that these can be executed more efficiently.
- Maintainability

According to the IEEE 610.12-1990 standard, software maintenance is understood to be ""the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment"".
- Legibility

Introduction

Implementation of the required automation functions is often possible with PCS 7 in various ways. The work steps described in this document for project creation, configuration and parameter assignment provide the basis for the PCS 7 application to be created. The following aspects play an important role in this for the complete runtime of the system:

- Availability

The availability of the overall system can be influenced by appropriate actions in the PCS 7 application starting in the planning phase.
- Expandability

Expansions and/or changes will need to be made repeatedly following the initial commissioning of a PCS 7 system. Attention must be paid to this when creating the PCS 7 application so that these can be executed more efficiently.
- Maintainability

According to the IEEE 610.12-1990 standard, software maintenance is understood to be ""the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment"".
- Legibility

Among other things, one of the principles of programming in IT theory is that the software must be created legibly. The requirements are that the code is well formatted, corresponding identifiers are used and meaningful comments are inserted.
