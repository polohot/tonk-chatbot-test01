# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

In this case a ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" with four paths can be configured between the two H-systems. The number of available paths is displayed via the connection's object properties, depending on the number of configured CP443-1 modules and the available networks.

This connection internally contains four paths, of which the first path is activated in operation. The second path is held in reserve and automatically takes on the active role in the event of a fault. The third and fourth paths are passively broken at the beginning.

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

High availability communication (2 paths or 4 paths)

A ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" is always used for communication between fault-tolerant systems. The following connection partners are possible:

- For a simple plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 1x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x CP 443-1
- PC station with C16xx
- For a redundant plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 2x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x or 4x CP 443-1
- PC station with 2x CP16xx

# Communication between H systems and standard AS

Note

Fault-tolerant AS-AS communication is not possible between fault-tolerant systems and standard systems in PCS 7 as standard, meaning that AS-wide interconnections also cannot be used.

You can instead create two standard S7 connections and then realize the fault-tolerance as an application-specific block solution. The following provide the options for this:

- Industry-Library (ASSendH and ASRecvH)
- Library S7H4_BSR (also for older PCS 7 versions)

You can find further information in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Industry Library for PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109750809) manual.

# Introduction

Once you have configured the stations and created the network connections, you have to download the configuration data to the stations (AS/PC stations). At this point, the Station Configuration Editors of the OS servers must have already been made ready for operation with the ""Configure target system"" function (Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)). Compile and save your configuration in NetPro for this purpose. All stations have a ""white"" status color when the configuration is without errors. For an initial configuration, perform the ""PLC > Download to Current Project > Selected Stations"" function for all automation and PC stations (only possible with the AS in STOP mode).

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

In this case a ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" with four paths can be configured between the two H-systems. The number of available paths is displayed via the connection's object properties, depending on the number of configured CP443-1 modules and the available networks.

This connection internally contains four paths, of which the first path is activated in operation. The second path is held in reserve and automatically takes on the active role in the event of a fault. The third and fourth paths are passively broken at the beginning.

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

High availability communication (2 paths or 4 paths)

A ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" is always used for communication between fault-tolerant systems. The following connection partners are possible:

- For a simple plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 1x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x CP 443-1
- PC station with C16xx
- For a redundant plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 2x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x or 4x CP 443-1
- PC station with 2x CP16xx

# Communication between H systems and standard AS

Note

Fault-tolerant AS-AS communication is not possible between fault-tolerant systems and standard systems in PCS 7 as standard, meaning that AS-wide interconnections also cannot be used.

You can instead create two standard S7 connections and then realize the fault-tolerance as an application-specific block solution. The following provide the options for this:

- Industry-Library (ASSendH and ASRecvH)
- Library S7H4_BSR (also for older PCS 7 versions)

You can find further information in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Industry Library for PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109750809) manual.

# Introduction

Once you have configured the stations and created the network connections, you have to download the configuration data to the stations (AS/PC stations). At this point, the Station Configuration Editors of the OS servers must have already been made ready for operation with the ""Configure target system"" function (Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)). Compile and save your configuration in NetPro for this purpose. All stations have a ""white"" status color when the configuration is without errors. For an initial configuration, perform the ""PLC > Download to Current Project > Selected Stations"" function for all automation and PC stations (only possible with the AS in STOP mode).

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

In this case a ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" with four paths can be configured between the two H-systems. The number of available paths is displayed via the connection's object properties, depending on the number of configured CP443-1 modules and the available networks.

This connection internally contains four paths, of which the first path is activated in operation. The second path is held in reserve and automatically takes on the active role in the event of a fault. The third and fourth paths are passively broken at the beginning.

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

High availability communication (2 paths or 4 paths)

A ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" is always used for communication between fault-tolerant systems. The following connection partners are possible:

- For a simple plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 1x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x CP 443-1
- PC station with C16xx
- For a redundant plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 2x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x or 4x CP 443-1
- PC station with 2x CP16xx

# Communication between H systems and standard AS

Note

Fault-tolerant AS-AS communication is not possible between fault-tolerant systems and standard systems in PCS 7 as standard, meaning that AS-wide interconnections also cannot be used.

You can instead create two standard S7 connections and then realize the fault-tolerance as an application-specific block solution. The following provide the options for this:

- Industry-Library (ASSendH and ASRecvH)
- Library S7H4_BSR (also for older PCS 7 versions)

You can find further information in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Industry Library for PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109750809) manual.

# Introduction

Once you have configured the stations and created the network connections, you have to download the configuration data to the stations (AS/PC stations). At this point, the Station Configuration Editors of the OS servers must have already been made ready for operation with the ""Configure target system"" function (Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)). Compile and save your configuration in NetPro for this purpose. All stations have a ""white"" status color when the configuration is without errors. For an initial configuration, perform the ""PLC > Download to Current Project > Selected Stations"" function for all automation and PC stations (only possible with the AS in STOP mode).

In this case a ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" with four paths can be configured between the two H-systems. The number of available paths is displayed via the connection's object properties, depending on the number of configured CP443-1 modules and the available networks.

This connection internally contains four paths, of which the first path is activated in operation. The second path is held in reserve and automatically takes on the active role in the event of a fault. The third and fourth paths are passively broken at the beginning.

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

High availability communication (2 paths or 4 paths)

A ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" is always used for communication between fault-tolerant systems. The following connection partners are possible:

- For a simple plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 1x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x CP 443-1
- PC station with C16xx
- For a redundant plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 2x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x or 4x CP 443-1
- PC station with 2x CP16xx

# Communication between H systems and standard AS

Note

Fault-tolerant AS-AS communication is not possible between fault-tolerant systems and standard systems in PCS 7 as standard, meaning that AS-wide interconnections also cannot be used.

You can instead create two standard S7 connections and then realize the fault-tolerance as an application-specific block solution. The following provide the options for this:

- Industry-Library (ASSendH and ASRecvH)
- Library S7H4_BSR (also for older PCS 7 versions)

At this point, the Station Configuration Editors of the OS servers must have already been made ready for operation with the ""Configure target system"" function (Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)). Compile and save your configuration in NetPro for this purpose. All stations have a ""white"" status color when the configuration is without errors. For an initial configuration, perform the ""PLC > Download to Current Project > Selected Stations"" function for all automation and PC stations (only possible with the AS in STOP mode).

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

In this case a ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" with four paths can be configured between the two H-systems. The number of available paths is displayed via the connection's object properties, depending on the number of configured CP443-1 modules and the available networks.

This connection internally contains four paths, of which the first path is activated in operation. The second path is held in reserve and automatically takes on the active role in the event of a fault. The third and fourth paths are passively broken at the beginning.

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

High availability communication (2 paths or 4 paths)

A ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" is always used for communication between fault-tolerant systems. The following connection partners are possible:

- For a simple plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 1x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x CP 443-1
- PC station with C16xx
- For a redundant plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 2x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x or 4x CP 443-1
- PC station with 2x CP16xx

# Communication between H systems and standard AS

Note

Fault-tolerant AS-AS communication is not possible between fault-tolerant systems and standard systems in PCS 7 as standard, meaning that AS-wide interconnections also cannot be used.

You can instead create two standard S7 connections and then realize the fault-tolerance as an application-specific block solution. The following provide the options for this:

- Industry-Library (ASSendH and ASRecvH)
- Library S7H4_BSR (also for older PCS 7 versions)

You can find further information in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Industry Library for PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109750809) manual.

# Introduction

Once you have configured the stations and created the network connections, you have to download the configuration data to the stations (AS/PC stations). At this point, the Station Configuration Editors of the OS servers must have already been made ready for operation with the ""Configure target system"" function (Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)). Compile and save your configuration in NetPro for this purpose. All stations have a ""white"" status color when the configuration is without errors. For an initial configuration, perform the ""PLC > Download to Current Project > Selected Stations"" function for all automation and PC stations (only possible with the AS in STOP mode).

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

In this case a ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" with four paths can be configured between the two H-systems. The number of available paths is displayed via the connection's object properties, depending on the number of configured CP443-1 modules and the available networks.

This connection internally contains four paths, of which the first path is activated in operation. The second path is held in reserve and automatically takes on the active role in the event of a fault. The third and fourth paths are passively broken at the beginning.

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

High availability communication (2 paths or 4 paths)

A ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" is always used for communication between fault-tolerant systems. The following connection partners are possible:

- For a simple plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 1x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x CP 443-1
- PC station with C16xx
- For a redundant plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 2x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x or 4x CP 443-1
- PC station with 2x CP16xx

# Communication between H systems and standard AS

Note

Fault-tolerant AS-AS communication is not possible between fault-tolerant systems and standard systems in PCS 7 as standard, meaning that AS-wide interconnections also cannot be used.

You can instead create two standard S7 connections and then realize the fault-tolerance as an application-specific block solution. The following provide the options for this:

- Industry-Library (ASSendH and ASRecvH)
- Library S7H4_BSR (also for older PCS 7 versions)

You can find further information in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Industry Library for PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109750809) manual.

Once you have configured the stations and created the network connections, you have to download the configuration data to the stations (AS/PC stations). At this point, the Station Configuration Editors of the OS servers must have already been made ready for operation with the ""Configure target system"" function (Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)). Compile and save your configuration in NetPro for this purpose. All stations have a ""white"" status color when the configuration is without errors. For an initial configuration, perform the ""PLC > Download to Current Project > Selected Stations"" function for all automation and PC stations (only possible with the AS in STOP mode).

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

In this case a ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" with four paths can be configured between the two H-systems. The number of available paths is displayed via the connection's object properties, depending on the number of configured CP443-1 modules and the available networks.

This connection internally contains four paths, of which the first path is activated in operation. The second path is held in reserve and automatically takes on the active role in the event of a fault. The third and fourth paths are passively broken at the beginning.

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

High availability communication (2 paths or 4 paths)

A ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" is always used for communication between fault-tolerant systems. The following connection partners are possible:

- For a simple plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 1x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x CP 443-1
- PC station with C16xx
- For a redundant plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 2x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x or 4x CP 443-1
- PC station with 2x CP16xx

# Communication between H systems and standard AS

Note

Fault-tolerant AS-AS communication is not possible between fault-tolerant systems and standard systems in PCS 7 as standard, meaning that AS-wide interconnections also cannot be used.

You can instead create two standard S7 connections and then realize the fault-tolerance as an application-specific block solution. The following provide the options for this:

- Industry-Library (ASSendH and ASRecvH)
- Library S7H4_BSR (also for older PCS 7 versions)

You can find further information in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Industry Library for PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109750809) manual.

# Introduction

Once you have configured the stations and created the network connections, you have to download the configuration data to the stations (AS/PC stations). At this point, the Station Configuration Editors of the OS servers must have already been made ready for operation with the ""Configure target system"" function (Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)). Compile and save your configuration in NetPro for this purpose. All stations have a ""white"" status color when the configuration is without errors. For an initial configuration, perform the ""PLC > Download to Current Project > Selected Stations"" function for all automation and PC stations (only possible with the AS in STOP mode).

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

In this case a ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" with four paths can be configured between the two H-systems. The number of available paths is displayed via the connection's object properties, depending on the number of configured CP443-1 modules and the available networks.

This connection internally contains four paths, of which the first path is activated in operation. The second path is held in reserve and automatically takes on the active role in the event of a fault. The third and fourth paths are passively broken at the beginning.

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

High availability communication (2 paths or 4 paths)

A ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" is always used for communication between fault-tolerant systems. The following connection partners are possible:

- For a simple plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 1x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x CP 443-1
- PC station with C16xx
- For a redundant plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 2x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x or 4x CP 443-1
- PC station with 2x CP16xx

# Communication between H systems and standard AS

Note

Fault-tolerant AS-AS communication is not possible between fault-tolerant systems and standard systems in PCS 7 as standard, meaning that AS-wide interconnections also cannot be used.

You can instead create two standard S7 connections and then realize the fault-tolerance as an application-specific block solution. The following provide the options for this:

- Industry-Library (ASSendH and ASRecvH)
- Library S7H4_BSR (also for older PCS 7 versions)

# Introduction

Once you have configured the stations and created the network connections, you have to download the configuration data to the stations (AS/PC stations). At this point, the Station Configuration Editors of the OS servers must have already been made ready for operation with the ""Configure target system"" function (Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)). Compile and save your configuration in NetPro for this purpose. All stations have a ""white"" status color when the configuration is without errors. For an initial configuration, perform the ""PLC > Download to Current Project > Selected Stations"" function for all automation and PC stations (only possible with the AS in STOP mode).

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

In this case a ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" with four paths can be configured between the two H-systems. The number of available paths is displayed via the connection's object properties, depending on the number of configured CP443-1 modules and the available networks.

This connection internally contains four paths, of which the first path is activated in operation. The second path is held in reserve and automatically takes on the active role in the event of a fault. The third and fourth paths are passively broken at the beginning.

# 7.2 Configuration of the connections

High availability communication (2 paths or 4 paths)

A ""S7 connection fault-tolerant"" is always used for communication between fault-tolerant systems. The following connection partners are possible:

- For a simple plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 1x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x CP 443-1
- PC station with C16xx
- For a redundant plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 2x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x or 4x CP 443-1
- PC station with 2x CP16xx

# Communication between H systems and standard AS

Note

Fault-tolerant AS-AS communication is not possible between fault-tolerant systems and standard systems in PCS 7 as standard, meaning that AS-wide interconnections also cannot be used.

You can instead create two standard S7 connections and then realize the fault-tolerance as an application-specific block solution. The following provide the options for this:

- Industry-Library (ASSendH and ASRecvH)
- Library S7H4_BSR (also for older PCS 7 versions)

You can find further information in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Industry Library for PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109750809) manual.

# 7.3 Downloading connections

# Introduction

Once you have configured the stations and created the network connections, you have to download the configuration data to the stations (AS/PC stations). At this point, the Station Configuration Editors of the OS servers must have already been made ready for operation with the ""Configure target system"" function (Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)). Compile and save your configuration in NetPro for this purpose. All stations have a ""white"" status color when the configuration is without errors. For an initial configuration, perform the ""PLC > Download to Current Project > Selected Stations"" function for all automation and PC stations (only possible with the AS in STOP mode).

# Configuration of the network connections

# 7.3 Downloading connections

For new or modified S7 connections, select the corresponding connection and use the ""PLC &gt; Download to Current Project &gt; Selected Connections"" function (possible with the AS in RUN mode).

Note

The active AS-AS connections are briefly interrupted when the ""PLC &gt; Download to Current Project &gt; Connections and Gateways"" function is used for an AS. This interruption will not affect the output parameters for the standard blocks of the CFC library (REC_R, REC_BO). Only the ""PLC &gt; Download to Current Project &gt; Selected Stations"" function is possible for a PC station. The OS will then need to be compiled and downloaded if AS-OS connections are changed.
