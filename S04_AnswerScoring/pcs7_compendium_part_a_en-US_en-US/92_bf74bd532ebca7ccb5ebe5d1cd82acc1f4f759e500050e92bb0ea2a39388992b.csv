# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.2 Selecting a preferred server

Introduction

In order to achieve even utilization of a redundant server pair and constant operability, even during a switchover to the redundancy partner, you should assign one section of the OS clients to the master server and another to the standby server.

A ""preferred server"" is an OS server in the redundant OS server pair that the OS client connects to preferentially. The OS client receives the data from there as long as this OS server is available.

This requires a consistent connection configuration on both OS servers and no errors (redundancy) at the PCS 7 end. If the connection configuration is inconsistent or if there are errors in the redundancy connections, the OS client switches to the OS server with the most active/error-free connections.

Note

If no preferred server is entered in the ""Configure the Server Data"" dialog, the OS clients interconnect to the OS server that is designated as the master.

In order to achieve even utilization of a redundant server pair and constant operability, even during a switchover to the redundancy partner, you should assign one section of the OS clients to the master server and another to the standby server.

A ""preferred server"" is an OS server in the redundant OS server pair that the OS client connects to preferentially. The OS client receives the data from there as long as this OS server is available.

This requires a consistent connection configuration on both OS servers and no errors (redundancy) at the PCS 7 end. If the connection configuration is inconsistent or if there are errors in the redundancy connections, the OS client switches to the OS server with the most active/error-free connections.

Note

If no preferred server is entered in the ""Configure the Server Data"" dialog, the OS clients interconnect to the OS server that is designated as the master.

Introduction

You configure a standard server for a client in a distributed system to:

- Receive messages and alarms
- Make the user-configured message classes available on a client
- Create operator messages on the client
- Make trend groups assembled on a client available to other clients
- Have access to user archives

A standard server setting is required on each client.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.3 Selecting and configuring a standard server

Introduction

You configure a standard server for a client in a distributed system to:

- Receive messages and alarms
- Make the user-configured message classes available on a client
- Create operator messages on the client
- Make trend groups assembled on a client available to other clients
- Have access to user archives

A standard server setting is required on each client.

Note

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.2 Selecting a preferred server

Introduction

In order to achieve even utilization of a redundant server pair and constant operability, even during a switchover to the redundancy partner, you should assign one section of the OS clients to the master server and another to the standby server.

A ""preferred server"" is an OS server in the redundant OS server pair that the OS client connects to preferentially. The OS client receives the data from there as long as this OS server is available.

This requires a consistent connection configuration on both OS servers and no errors (redundancy) at the PCS 7 end. If the connection configuration is inconsistent or if there are errors in the redundancy connections, the OS client switches to the OS server with the most active/error-free connections.

Note

If no preferred server is entered in the ""Configure the Server Data"" dialog, the OS clients interconnect to the OS server that is designated as the master.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.2 Selecting a preferred server

Introduction

In order to achieve even utilization of a redundant server pair and constant operability, even during a switchover to the redundancy partner, you should assign one section of the OS clients to the master server and another to the standby server.

A ""preferred server"" is an OS server in the redundant OS server pair that the OS client connects to preferentially. The OS client receives the data from there as long as this OS server is available.

This requires a consistent connection configuration on both OS servers and no errors (redundancy) at the PCS 7 end. If the connection configuration is inconsistent or if there are errors in the redundancy connections, the OS client switches to the OS server with the most active/error-free connections.

Note

If no preferred server is entered in the ""Configure the Server Data"" dialog, the OS clients interconnect to the OS server that is designated as the master.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.2 Selecting a preferred server

Introduction

In order to achieve even utilization of a redundant server pair and constant operability, even during a switchover to the redundancy partner, you should assign one section of the OS clients to the master server and another to the standby server.

A ""preferred server"" is an OS server in the redundant OS server pair that the OS client connects to preferentially. The OS client receives the data from there as long as this OS server is available.

This requires a consistent connection configuration on both OS servers and no errors (redundancy) at the PCS 7 end. If the connection configuration is inconsistent or if there are errors in the redundancy connections, the OS client switches to the OS server with the most active/error-free connections.

Note

If no preferred server is entered in the ""Configure the Server Data"" dialog, the OS clients interconnect to the OS server that is designated as the master.

Introduction

You configure a standard server for a client in a distributed system to:

- Receive messages and alarms
- Make the user-configured message classes available on a client
- Create operator messages on the client
- Make trend groups assembled on a client available to other clients
- Have access to user archives

A standard server setting is required on each client.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.3 Selecting and configuring a standard server

Introduction

You configure a standard server for a client in a distributed system to:

- Receive messages and alarms
- Make the user-configured message classes available on a client
- Create operator messages on the client
- Make trend groups assembled on a client available to other clients
- Have access to user archives

A standard server setting is required on each client.

Note

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.2 Selecting a preferred server

Introduction

In order to achieve even utilization of a redundant server pair and constant operability, even during a switchover to the redundancy partner, you should assign one section of the OS clients to the master server and another to the standby server.

A ""preferred server"" is an OS server in the redundant OS server pair that the OS client connects to preferentially. The OS client receives the data from there as long as this OS server is available.

This requires a consistent connection configuration on both OS servers and no errors (redundancy) at the PCS 7 end. If the connection configuration is inconsistent or if there are errors in the redundancy connections, the OS client switches to the OS server with the most active/error-free connections.

Note

If no preferred server is entered in the ""Configure the Server Data"" dialog, the OS clients interconnect to the OS server that is designated as the master.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.2 Selecting a preferred server

Introduction

In order to achieve even utilization of a redundant server pair and constant operability, even during a switchover to the redundancy partner, you should assign one section of the OS clients to the master server and another to the standby server.

A ""preferred server"" is an OS server in the redundant OS server pair that the OS client connects to preferentially. The OS client receives the data from there as long as this OS server is available.

This requires a consistent connection configuration on both OS servers and no errors (redundancy) at the PCS 7 end. If the connection configuration is inconsistent or if there are errors in the redundancy connections, the OS client switches to the OS server with the most active/error-free connections.

Note

If no preferred server is entered in the ""Configure the Server Data"" dialog, the OS clients interconnect to the OS server that is designated as the master.
