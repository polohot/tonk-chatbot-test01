The Information Server is the Process Historian reporting system for compiling and evaluating data or presenting it in graphic form. Based on Microsoft Reporting Services it provides web-based access to historical data.

",What functions does the Process Historian (PH) include according to the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)'?,A1,"The PH includes functions like system requirements check during reconfiguration, prompt availability of OS process data, native archiving of Batch archives from SIMATIC BATCH, support for single stations and multiple PCS 7 projects, access to historical process data via web and Office applications, and more.",2.5,2.609375,3.59375,1.7265625,0.9453125

Messages and process values can be displayed both in tabular form as well as graphically. The saved data is divided into segments for processing and managing very large amounts of data.

The following picture shows an example of the segmenting setting in the PH:

The MS SQL server is used for the data archiving. The saved archive segments can be saved as a backup file on a hard disk and then deleted (backup/restore). This prevents the memory capacity of the data base hard disk from becoming completely full.

The PH does not need a connection to the plant bus. It can be connected to the OS and Batch Servers of the SIMATIC PCS 7 plant via terminal bus, for example, using the integrated network connection (on-board Ethernet RJ45 port) of the server.

The PH is suitable as long-term data storage for PCS 7 projects. You can swap out the data from multiple projects/multiprojects to a PH.

# Hardware requirements

Using an ""IPC 847D"" type server is recommended for PCS 7 plants with one OS server and a maximum archiving load of 1,500 values/sec. With intensive use a PH system is not a typical application area for an IPC. For this reason, use of server hardware that offers more options for hard disk configuration is recommended for larger plants.

Introduction

The Information Server is the Process Historian reporting system for compiling and evaluating data or presenting it in graphic form. Based on Microsoft Reporting Services it provides web-based access to historical data.

Messages and process values can be displayed both in tabular form as well as graphically. The saved data is divided into segments for processing and managing very large amounts of data.

The following picture shows an example of the segmenting setting in the PH:

The MS SQL server is used for the data archiving. The saved archive segments can be saved as a backup file on a hard disk and then deleted (backup/restore). This prevents the memory capacity of the data base hard disk from becoming completely full.

The PH does not need a connection to the plant bus. It can be connected to the OS and Batch Servers of the SIMATIC PCS 7 plant via terminal bus, for example, using the integrated network connection (on-board Ethernet RJ45 port) of the server.

The PH is suitable as long-term data storage for PCS 7 projects. You can swap out the data from multiple projects/multiprojects to a PH.

The MS SQL server is used for the data archiving. The saved archive segments can be saved as a backup file on a hard disk and then deleted (backup/restore). This prevents the memory capacity of the data base hard disk from becoming completely full.

The PH does not need a connection to the plant bus. It can be connected to the OS and Batch Servers of the SIMATIC PCS 7 plant via terminal bus, for example, using the integrated network connection (on-board Ethernet RJ45 port) of the server.

The PH is suitable as long-term data storage for PCS 7 projects. You can swap out the data from multiple projects/multiprojects to a PH.

# Hardware requirements

Using an ""IPC 847D"" type server is recommended for PCS 7 plants with one OS server and a maximum archiving load of 1,500 values/sec. With intensive use a PH system is not a typical application area for an IPC. For this reason, use of server hardware that offers more options for hard disk configuration is recommended for larger plants.

# Hardware requirements

Using an ""IPC 847D"" type server is recommended for PCS 7 plants with one OS server and a maximum archiving load of 1,500 values/sec. With intensive use a PH system is not a typical application area for an IPC. For this reason, use of server hardware that offers more options for hard disk configuration is recommended for larger plants.

The hardware assistant ""PH-HWAdvisor"" assists you in identifying a suitable hardware configuration. You can download the ""PH-HWAdvisor"" at the following link: https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109740115

To fully integrate the Process Historian in your PCS 7 environment, we recommend that you save the database and segment backups to an iSCSI NAS drive. You can find a relevant example in the ""Using an iSCSI network attached storage (NAS) for Process Historian backups"" https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/66579062 FAQ.

Introduction

The Information Server is the Process Historian reporting system for compiling and evaluating data or presenting it in graphic form. Based on Microsoft Reporting Services it provides web-based access to historical data.

Messages and process values can be displayed both in tabular form as well as graphically. The saved data is divided into segments for processing and managing very large amounts of data.

The following picture shows an example of the segmenting setting in the PH:

The MS SQL server is used for the data archiving. The saved archive segments can be saved as a backup file on a hard disk and then deleted (backup/restore). This prevents the memory capacity of the data base hard disk from becoming completely full.

The PH does not need a connection to the plant bus. It can be connected to the OS and Batch Servers of the SIMATIC PCS 7 plant via terminal bus, for example, using the integrated network connection (on-board Ethernet RJ45 port) of the server.

The PH is suitable as long-term data storage for PCS 7 projects. You can swap out the data from multiple projects/multiprojects to a PH.

# Functions of the Process Historian

The PH includes the following functions:

- When the PH is reconfigured, a wizard checks the system requirements (operating system, RAM, HDD, etc.) for PH operation and prevents setup if the requirements are not met.
- All OS process data is available promptly in the PH.
- Batch archives from SIMATIC BATCH are saved with native archiving in the PH.
- The PH also supports single stations.
- The PH supports multiple PCS 7 projects in parallel.
- Access to historical process data via web and Office applications.
- Widely-distributed standard reporting system which is adapted to PCS 7 reporting, including standard report templates.
- Process data can be presented in reports.
- Report templates can be created and adapted flexibly.
- Data from the PH can be presented at the OS runtime level with the WinCC Trend Control und WinCC Alarm Control.
- PH data can be accessed via OPC HDA and OPC UA in connection with the OpenPCS 7 station.
- Backup/restore function on hard disks.
- The status of the PH server can be visually displayed on the OS client.
- OPC UA server on the Process Historian
- PH redundancy

# Licensing

A ""Process Historian Server"" basic license is required to operate the PH. The ""Process Historian Server Redundancy"" license is required for a redundantly configured system. This includes a redundancy license in addition to the basic license. The ""Process Historian and Information Server"" license is offered for a combined PH and Information Server.

Note
As of PCS 7 V8.0 SP1, no countable PH archive license is required for a PCS 7 OS as a PH data source.

There are the following license types for the PH:

- Process Historian server
- Process Historian Server Redundancy
- Process Historian Archive-BATCH
- Process Historian OPC UA Server
