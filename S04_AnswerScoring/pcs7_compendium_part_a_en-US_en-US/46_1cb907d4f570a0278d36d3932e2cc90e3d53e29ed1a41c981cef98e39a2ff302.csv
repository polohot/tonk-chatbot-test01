- The plant designation (HID) is composed of a block name, CFC chart name and sometimes a hierarchy folder name. In principle the HID should be kept as short as possible. We recommend using CFC chart names (process tag name) that are unique throughout the project. Incorporation of the hierarchical folder names can be avoided in the HID (see section ""Make PH settings""). If the plant naming convention is to be based on additional functional factors, the hierarchy folder names can still be integrated in the HID. The length of the HID should be limited to ensure that it can be fully displayed in all OS editing windows. The number of characters in the name of the hierarchy folders should not exceed this limit. Names with characters that exceed this limit will not be fully displayed in the HID.
