Pay attention to the operating instructions for the relevant PC hardware before unpacking. In particular compliance with the environmental conditions, the prescribed installation and correct connection of I/O and power supply devices helps to avoid faults and increase availability.

You can improve the security and stability of the PCS 7 plant by installing all PC stations in lockable control cabinets.

The following options, among others, are available to you as possible hardware expansions:

- Optional graphics expansion (dual head graphics card PCIe x16) for multi-monitor operation with up to 4 monitors (up to 2 monitors with onboard graphics)
- Acoustic or visual signal transmitter → signal module
- Acoustic signal transmitter → sound card
- Time signal, e.g. via SICLOCK time transmitter → time reception service
- Smart cards → smart card reader
