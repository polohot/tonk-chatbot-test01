# 4.2.7 User administration

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

In the workgroup, the majority of settings have to be made on the local computer. If a PCS 7 plant is running with fixed settings, however, and few changes are expected, these settings only need to be made once. In this case, additional time for creating a domain and providing extra training for the operating personnel is not required.

# 4.2.7 User administration

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

In the workgroup, the majority of settings have to be made on the local computer. If a PCS 7 plant is running with fixed settings, however, and few changes are expected, these settings only need to be made once. In this case, additional time for creating a domain and providing extra training for the operating personnel is not required.

# 4.2.7 User administration

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

# Workgroup example

In the workgroup, the majority of settings have to be made on the local computer. If a PCS 7 plant is running with fixed settings, however, and few changes are expected, these settings only need to be made once. In this case, additional time for creating a domain and providing extra training for the operating personnel is not required.

# 4.2.7 User administration

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

In the workgroup, the majority of settings have to be made on the local computer. If a PCS 7 plant is running with fixed settings, however, and few changes are expected, these settings only need to be made once. In this case, additional time for creating a domain and providing extra training for the operating personnel is not required.

# Integration in a domain

All PCs in the PCS 7 product bundles are configured for a Windows workgroup. If you include preconfigured PC systems in a Windows domain, you must reactivate the security settings using the SIMATIC ""Security Controller"" software.

# 4.2.7 User administration

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

# Workgroup example

In the workgroup, the majority of settings have to be made on the local computer. If a PCS 7 plant is running with fixed settings, however, and few changes are expected, these settings only need to be made once. In this case, additional time for creating a domain and providing extra training for the operating personnel is not required.

# Integration in a domain

All PCs in the PCS 7 product bundles are configured for a Windows workgroup. If you include preconfigured PC systems in a Windows domain, you must reactivate the security settings using the SIMATIC ""Security Controller"" software.

# 4.2.7 User administration

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

In the workgroup, the majority of settings have to be made on the local computer. If a PCS 7 plant is running with fixed settings, however, and few changes are expected, these settings only need to be made once. In this case, additional time for creating a domain and providing extra training for the operating personnel is not required.

# 4.2.7 User administration

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

In the workgroup, the majority of settings have to be made on the local computer. If a PCS 7 plant is running with fixed settings, however, and few changes are expected, these settings only need to be made once. In this case, additional time for creating a domain and providing extra training for the operating personnel is not required.

# 4.2.7 User administration

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

# 4.2.7 User administration

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the ""user"" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual ""Process Historian: Administration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 ""SIMATIC BATCH"" and ""SIMATIC Route Control"" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

# Working environment

You have the option of operating the computers in your PCS 7 plant in a workgroup or domain environment.

The following tables present a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages (from a technical perspective) as well as scenarios (examples) and their use in workgroups and domains.

Note

This information is provided as a basis for discussion to assist you in the selection of the appropriate environment for your computers. In addition to the technical criteria, also consider organizational criteria (for example, plant-specific IT, Microsoft expertise, resources, workload and maintenance, etc.).

# Workgroup example

In the workgroup, the majority of settings have to be made on the local computer. If a PCS 7 plant is running with fixed settings, however, and few changes are expected, these settings only need to be made once. In this case, additional time for creating a domain and providing extra training for the operating personnel is not required.
