# 10.1.9 Graphics Runtime on the OS servers

The following alternative measures are recommended for the purpose of reducing the load for OS servers which are not used as operating stations at the same time:

- Selecting the ""SIMATIC Server"" server layout in the OS project editor in the ""Layout"" tab. Generally applies to all OS servers, in particular OS servers with more than 4 OS clients. Granting of rights in accordance with the User Administrator and locking to prevent unauthorized key combinations is possible with this.
- Deactivation of the graphics runtime and the associated applications, e.g. SFCRT (visualization of SFC blocks) in the startup list in ""Computer properties"". Additional applications that have been added through the individual WinCC editors of the startup list cannot be removed.

# 10.1.9 Graphics Runtime on the OS servers

The following alternative measures are recommended for the purpose of reducing the load for OS servers which are not used as operating stations at the same time:

- Selecting the ""SIMATIC Server"" server layout in the OS project editor in the ""Layout"" tab. Generally applies to all OS servers, in particular OS servers with more than 4 OS clients. Granting of rights in accordance with the User Administrator and locking to prevent unauthorized key combinations is possible with this.
- Deactivation of the graphics runtime and the associated applications, e.g. SFCRT (visualization of SFC blocks) in the startup list in ""Computer properties"". Additional applications that have been added through the individual WinCC editors of the startup list cannot be removed.

The wait times when opening pictures/faceplates depend on, among other things, the load of the AS from which the data for the corresponding picture/faceplate is obtained. A faceplate can therefore have different display times in two different automation systems when the associated block is activated.

You can find further information on diagnosing the reasons and on taking corrective actions in the ""How do you shorten any delays in the display of screens/faceplates in the PCS 7 OS?"" FAQ.

# Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements

The wait times when opening pictures/faceplates depend on, among other things, the load of the AS from which the data for the corresponding picture/faceplate is obtained. A faceplate can therefore have different display times in two different automation systems when the associated block is activated.

You can find further information on diagnosing the reasons and on taking corrective actions in the ""How do you shorten any delays in the display of screens/faceplates in the PCS 7 OS?"" FAQ.

The limiting values recommended in this section for OS servers or OS single stations are based on empirical values. They are listed as OS quantity structures in the event of Alarm Logging and Tag Logging in the PCS 7 catalog.

# Work station

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if enough hard disk space is available for operation of the Microsoft SQL Server.

System partition (C): The available hard disk space must be greater than 20%.

# Task Manager

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the following values are adhered to within the Task Manager:

- System performance: Processor utilization less than 30% on average
- System performance: Available physical memory greater than 200 MB

# Alarm Logging

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the constant load of messages for an OS server is less than 10 messages per second. The check can be made by additional configuration of an Alarm Control as a hitlist in a process picture.

# Tag Logging

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the tag logging for an OS server is less than 1500 values per second. For this monitor the internal tags @TLGRT_TAGS_PER_SECOND and @TLGRT_AVERAGE_TAGS_PER_SECOND in the TagLoggingRT group.

# Note

Check the configuration as well as the associated infrastructure if these limiting values are being reached or even exceeded.

The wait times when opening pictures/faceplates depend on, among other things, the load of the AS from which the data for the corresponding picture/faceplate is obtained. A faceplate can therefore have different display times in two different automation systems when the associated block is activated.

You can find further information on diagnosing the reasons and on taking corrective actions in the ""How do you shorten any delays in the display of screens/faceplates in the PCS 7 OS?"" FAQ.

# Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements

When limits are exceeded, appropriate measures must be taken to reduce the load of the OS server and to guarantee the performance of OS Runtime.

# 10.1.9 Graphics Runtime on the OS servers

The following alternative measures are recommended for the purpose of reducing the load for OS servers which are not used as operating stations at the same time:

- Selecting the ""SIMATIC Server"" server layout in the OS project editor in the ""Layout"" tab. Generally applies to all OS servers, in particular OS servers with more than 4 OS clients. Granting of rights in accordance with the User Administrator and locking to prevent unauthorized key combinations is possible with this.
- Deactivation of the graphics runtime and the associated applications, e.g. SFCRT (visualization of SFC blocks) in the startup list in ""Computer properties"". Additional applications that have been added through the individual WinCC editors of the startup list cannot be removed.

# 10.1.9 Graphics Runtime on the OS servers

The following alternative measures are recommended for the purpose of reducing the load for OS servers which are not used as operating stations at the same time:

- Selecting the ""SIMATIC Server"" server layout in the OS project editor in the ""Layout"" tab. Generally applies to all OS servers, in particular OS servers with more than 4 OS clients. Granting of rights in accordance with the User Administrator and locking to prevent unauthorized key combinations is possible with this.
- Deactivation of the graphics runtime and the associated applications, e.g. SFCRT (visualization of SFC blocks) in the startup list in ""Computer properties"". Additional applications that have been added through the individual WinCC editors of the startup list cannot be removed.

- System performance: Processor utilization less than 30% on average
- System performance: Available physical memory greater than 200 MB

# Alarm Logging

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the constant load of messages for an OS server is less than 10 messages per second. The check can be made by additional configuration of an Alarm Control as a hitlist in a process picture.

# Tag Logging

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the tag logging for an OS server is less than 1500 values per second. For this monitor the internal tags @TLGRT_TAGS_PER_SECOND and @TLGRT_AVERAGE_TAGS_PER_SECOND in the TagLoggingRT group.

The wait times when opening pictures/faceplates depend on, among other things, the load of the AS from which the data for the corresponding picture/faceplate is obtained. A faceplate can therefore have different display times in two different automation systems when the associated block is activated.

You can find further information on diagnosing the reasons and on taking corrective actions in the ""How do you shorten any delays in the display of screens/faceplates in the PCS 7 OS?"" FAQ.

- System performance: Available physical memory greater than 200 MB

# Alarm Logging

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the constant load of messages for an OS server is less than 10 messages per second. The check can be made by additional configuration of an Alarm Control as a hitlist in a process picture.

# Tag Logging

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the tag logging for an OS server is less than 1500 values per second. For this monitor the internal tags @TLGRT_TAGS_PER_SECOND and @TLGRT_AVERAGE_TAGS_PER_SECOND in the TagLoggingRT group.

# Note

Check the configuration as well as the associated infrastructure if these limiting values are being reached or even exceeded.

# AS-OS communication

The wait times when opening pictures/faceplates depend on, among other things, the load of the AS from which the data for the corresponding picture/faceplate is obtained. A faceplate can therefore have different display times in two different automation systems when the associated block is activated.

You can find further information on diagnosing the reasons and on taking corrective actions in the ""How do you shorten any delays in the display of screens/faceplates in the PCS 7 OS?"" FAQ.

# Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements

When limits are exceeded, appropriate measures must be taken to reduce the load of the OS server and to guarantee the performance of OS Runtime.

# 10.2.1 Structure of the picture hierarchy

You can create a hierarchical structure for the plant with up to 8 levels. Buttons are used to navigate between the process pictures.

# 10.1.9 Graphics Runtime on the OS servers

The following alternative measures are recommended for the purpose of reducing the load for OS servers which are not used as operating stations at the same time:

- Selecting the ""SIMATIC Server"" server layout in the OS project editor in the ""Layout"" tab. Generally applies to all OS servers, in particular OS servers with more than 4 OS clients. Granting of rights in accordance with the User Administrator and locking to prevent unauthorized key combinations is possible with this.
- Deactivation of the graphics runtime and the associated applications, e.g. SFCRT (visualization of SFC blocks) in the startup list in ""Computer properties"". Additional applications that have been added through the individual WinCC editors of the startup list cannot be removed.
