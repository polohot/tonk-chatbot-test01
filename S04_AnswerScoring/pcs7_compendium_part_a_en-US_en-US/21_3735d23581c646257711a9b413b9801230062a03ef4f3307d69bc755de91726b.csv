# 4.3.7 Configuring the plant bus

Communication of a PCS 7 ES via the plant bus

In SIMATIC PCS 7, the ""S7 online"" access point must be set to the ""PC internal"" interface. All access to the AS – in order to check the module information of an AS or to download S7 programs, for example – is performed via ""PC internal"". ""PC internal"" is a centrally configurable interface, which can be loaded with project-specific settings for all stations on the plant bus. The settings are made on the ES in the PCS 7 multiproject and downloaded from the ES. You can find the relevant procedure in Section ""Engineering Station (Page 64)"". The communication on the plant bus is normally based on the ISO protocol.

Note

Use TCP/IP on the plant bus under the following conditions:

- Shared (combined) terminal and plant bus for smaller systems without an OS server
- Routing via subnets required
- Use of an automation system with integrated Ethernet interface
- Use of NTP (Network Time Protocol) for time synchronization
- Monitoring of network components on the plant bus for asset management
- Operation of gateways on the plant bus (external connection of an AS)
- Configuration of ""S7 connection (fault-tolerant)"" for H-systems via the internal interface of the CPU 41x with PROFINET or CP443-1

Use the ISO protocol on the plant bus under the following conditions:

- Configuration of ""S7 connection (fault-tolerant)"" for H-systems (pertains to CPU firmware versions before V5)
- Time synchronization based on the SIMATIC procedure

Note

When fault-tolerant S7 connections via TCP/IP or ISO-on-TCP are used, set the monitoring time (multiplier x 100 ms) in the connection properties.

- Up to 12 connections: Multiplier 5 (0.5 s)
- Up to 30 connections: Multiplier 10 (1 s)
- Up to 80 connections: Multiplier 20 (2 s)
- Up to 120 connections: Multiplier 30 (3 s)

Communication of a PCS 7 ES via the plant bus

In SIMATIC PCS 7, the ""S7 online"" access point must be set to the ""PC internal"" interface. All access to the AS – in order to check the module information of an AS or to download S7 programs, for example – is performed via ""PC internal"". ""PC internal"" is a centrally configurable interface, which can be loaded with project-specific settings for all stations on the plant bus. The settings are made on the ES in the PCS 7 multiproject and downloaded from the ES. You can find the relevant procedure in Section ""Engineering Station (Page 64)"". The communication on the plant bus is normally based on the ISO protocol.

Note

Use TCP/IP on the plant bus under the following conditions:

- Shared (combined) terminal and plant bus for smaller systems without an OS server
- Routing via subnets required
- Use of an automation system with integrated Ethernet interface
- Use of NTP (Network Time Protocol) for time synchronization
- Monitoring of network components on the plant bus for asset management
- Operation of gateways on the plant bus (external connection of an AS)
- Configuration of ""S7 connection (fault-tolerant)"" for H-systems via the internal interface of the CPU 41x with PROFINET or CP443-1

Use the ISO protocol on the plant bus under the following conditions:

- Configuration of ""S7 connection (fault-tolerant)"" for H-systems (pertains to CPU firmware versions before V5)
- Time synchronization based on the SIMATIC procedure

Note

When fault-tolerant S7 connections via TCP/IP or ISO-on-TCP are used, set the monitoring time (multiplier x 100 ms) in the connection properties.

- Up to 12 connections: Multiplier 5 (0.5 s)
- Up to 30 connections: Multiplier 10 (1 s)
- Up to 80 connections: Multiplier 20 (2 s)
- Up to 120 connections: Multiplier 30 (3 s)

- Use of NTP (Network Time Protocol) for time synchronization
- Monitoring of network components on the plant bus for asset management
- Operation of gateways on the plant bus (external connection of an AS)
- Configuration of ""S7 connection (fault-tolerant)"" for H-systems via the internal interface of the CPU 41x with PROFINET or CP443-1

Use the ISO protocol on the plant bus under the following conditions:

- Configuration of ""S7 connection (fault-tolerant)"" for H-systems (pertains to CPU firmware versions before V5)
- Time synchronization based on the SIMATIC procedure

Note

When fault-tolerant S7 connections via TCP/IP or ISO-on-TCP are used, set the monitoring time (multiplier x 100 ms) in the connection properties.

- Up to 12 connections: Multiplier 5 (0.5 s)
- Up to 30 connections: Multiplier 10 (1 s)

Communication of a PCS 7 ES via the plant bus

In SIMATIC PCS 7, the ""S7 online"" access point must be set to the ""PC internal"" interface. All access to the AS – in order to check the module information of an AS or to download S7 programs, for example – is performed via ""PC internal"". ""PC internal"" is a centrally configurable interface, which can be loaded with project-specific settings for all stations on the plant bus. The settings are made on the ES in the PCS 7 multiproject and downloaded from the ES. You can find the relevant procedure in Section ""Engineering Station (Page 64)"". The communication on the plant bus is normally based on the ISO protocol.

Note

Use TCP/IP on the plant bus under the following conditions:

- Shared (combined) terminal and plant bus for smaller systems without an OS server
- Routing via subnets required
- Use of an automation system with integrated Ethernet interface
- Use of NTP (Network Time Protocol) for time synchronization
- Monitoring of network components on the plant bus for asset management
- Operation of gateways on the plant bus (external connection of an AS)
- Configuration of ""S7 connection (fault-tolerant)"" for H-systems via the internal interface of the CPU 41x with PROFINET or CP443-1

Use the ISO protocol on the plant bus under the following conditions:

- Configuration of ""S7 connection (fault-tolerant)"" for H-systems (pertains to CPU firmware versions before V5)
- Time synchronization based on the SIMATIC procedure

Note

When fault-tolerant S7 connections via TCP/IP or ISO-on-TCP are used, set the monitoring time (multiplier x 100 ms) in the connection properties.

""PC internal"" is a centrally configurable interface, which can be loaded with project-specific settings for all stations on the plant bus. The settings are made on the ES in the PCS 7 multiproject and downloaded from the ES. You can find the relevant procedure in Section ""Engineering Station (Page 64)"". The communication on the plant bus is normally based on the ISO protocol.

Note

Use TCP/IP on the plant bus under the following conditions:

- Shared (combined) terminal and plant bus for smaller systems without an OS server
- Routing via subnets required
- Use of an automation system with integrated Ethernet interface
- Use of NTP (Network Time Protocol) for time synchronization
- Monitoring of network components on the plant bus for asset management
- Operation of gateways on the plant bus (external connection of an AS)
- Configuration of ""S7 connection (fault-tolerant)"" for H-systems via the internal interface of the CPU 41x with PROFINET or CP443-1

Use the ISO protocol on the plant bus under the following conditions:

- Configuration of ""S7 connection (fault-tolerant)"" for H-systems (pertains to CPU firmware versions before V5)
- Time synchronization based on the SIMATIC procedure

Note

When fault-tolerant S7 connections via TCP/IP or ISO-on-TCP are used, set the monitoring time (multiplier x 100 ms) in the connection properties.

- Up to 12 connections: Multiplier 5 (0.5 s)
- Up to 30 connections: Multiplier 10 (1 s)
- Up to 80 connections: Multiplier 20 (2 s)
- Up to 120 connections: Multiplier 30 (3 s)
