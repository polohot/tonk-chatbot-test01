The following steps show how to configure the terminal bus for a PCS 7 system:

1. Rename the compatible network connection, e.g. ",Why is autonegotiation preferred over manual configuration in network settings according to the 'Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)'?,A3,"Preferable because it dynamically adjusts to the highest mutually supported settings, avoiding compatibility issues.",1.4296875,1.6640625,3.390625,1.34375,0.349609375

Autonegotiation enables the devices involved to negotiate the transmission conditions before data packets are transmitted. In so doing both the transmission rate (10/100/1000 Mbps) as well as the transmission mode are negotiated. Half-duplex or full-duplex are the options for the transmission method.

The following applies as of PCS 7 V6.1: Retain the factory settings.

Note

The only time you need to manually set the two components on the patch cable to a uniform transmission setting, for example 100 Mbps full-duplex, is when one of the components on the plant bus or terminal bus does not support the autonegotiation function. Deviating settings may lead to unpredictable error scenarios.
