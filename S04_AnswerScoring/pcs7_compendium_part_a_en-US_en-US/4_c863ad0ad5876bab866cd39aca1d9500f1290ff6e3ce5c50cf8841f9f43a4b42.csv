Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Preface

# Subject of the manual

As a distinctly open system, SIMATIC PCS 7 can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of customer needs. The system software provides the configuration engineer with a great deal of freedom in terms of project configuration, as well as in the design of the program and visualization.

Experience has shown that subsequent modernization or plant expansion work is made much easier if the project is configured in conformance with PCS 7 as far as possible right from the start. This means users must adhere to certain basic rules to ensure that the provided system functions will offer optimum usability in the future.

This manual serves as a compendium in addition to the product documentation for SIMATIC PCS 7. The basic tasks for creating and configuring the project are described in the form of instructions with numerous illustrations.

The compendium directly reflects the recommended method for configuration, which is based on the results of a great deal of practical experience. ",How does Siemens describe the flexibility of SIMATIC PCS 7 in terms of project configuration?,A1,"Siemens describes SIMATIC PCS 7 as a distinctly open system that can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of customer needs, offering considerable freedom in project configuration and program design.",2.953125,3.140625,3.71875,1.6484375,0.8359375

# Preface

# Subject of the manual

As a distinctly open system, SIMATIC PCS 7 can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of customer needs. The system software provides the configuration engineer with a great deal of freedom in terms of project configuration, as well as in the design of the program and visualization.

Experience has shown that subsequent modernization or plant expansion work is made much easier if the project is configured in conformance with PCS 7 as far as possible right from the start. This means users must adhere to certain basic rules to ensure that the provided system functions will offer optimum usability in the future.

This manual serves as a compendium in addition to the product documentation for SIMATIC PCS 7. The basic tasks for creating and configuring the project are described in the form of instructions with numerous illustrations.

Experience has shown that subsequent modernization or plant expansion work is made much easier if the project is configured in conformance with PCS 7 as far as possible right from the start. This means users must adhere to certain basic rules to ensure that the provided system functions will offer optimum usability in the future.

This manual serves as a compendium in addition to the product documentation for SIMATIC PCS 7. The basic tasks for creating and configuring the project are described in the form of instructions with numerous illustrations.

The compendium directly reflects the recommended method for configuration, which is based on the results of a great deal of practical experience.

# Preface

# Subject of the manual

As a distinctly open system, SIMATIC PCS 7 can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of customer needs. The system software provides the configuration engineer with a great deal of freedom in terms of project configuration, as well as in the design of the program and visualization.

Experience has shown that subsequent modernization or plant expansion work is made much easier if the project is configured in conformance with PCS 7 as far as possible right from the start. This means users must adhere to certain basic rules to ensure that the provided system functions will offer optimum usability in the future.

This manual serves as a compendium in addition to the product documentation for SIMATIC PCS 7. The basic tasks for creating and configuring the project are described in the form of instructions with numerous illustrations.

The compendium directly reflects the recommended method for configuration, which is based on the results of a great deal of practical experience.
