# 6.6.4 General rules for configuring I/O modules

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration.

# 6.6.4 General rules for configuring I/O modules

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration.

# 6.6.4 General rules for configuring I/O modules

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration.

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration.

# 6.6.4 General rules for configuring I/O modules

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration.

# 6.6.4 General rules for configuring I/O modules

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration.

# 6.6.4 General rules for configuring I/O modules

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration.

# 6.6.4 General rules for configuring I/O modules

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration.

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration.

# 6.6 Configuration of the I/O devices

1. For high-precision time stamping, select the ""Time-of-day synchronization"" option in the properties of the ET 200M station and set the synchronization interval to 10.00 s.
2. The ""Replace modules during operation"" option must be activated within the operating parameters where the ET 200 station is set up with an active backplane bus. For the connection to a redundant PROFIBUS, this option is preset and is grayed out because the active backplane bus is mandatory in this case.

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration.
