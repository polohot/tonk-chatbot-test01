However, it is not only creation of the PCS 7 solution that is defined and regulated with these guidelines. They also form a very good basis for all future work on a PCS 7 plant and provide consistent quality over the plant's entire lifecycle.

The following specifications must be observed:

- User Requirement Specification (URS)
- Functional Specification (FS)
- Design Specification (DS)

The test documents used for reviewing and documenting adherence to the specifications are just as important:

- Factory Acceptance Test (FAT), also known as Installation Qualification (IQ)
- Site Acceptance Test (SAT) also known as Operational Qualification (OQ)
- Performance Qualification (PQ)

These documents are used for quality assurance purposes during a plant's entire lifecycle. The PCS 7 compendia should be taken into account for the design guidelines and test specifications.

# 4.2.2 Plant concept

Introduction

The following plant concept is used in this documentation as an example for implementing process automation:

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

The concept presented consists of the following components:

- 1 engineering station (ES): Central station for configuring the complete automation solution.
- 2 automation systems (AS 410S and AS 410H): for automation of two plant areas, for example, ""Reactor 1"" and ""Reactor 2"".
- 1 OS server with redundant OS server as a partner station for providing the process pictures and process data for operating the plant.
- 4 OS clients for centralized and decentralized process operation.

This structure can be easily scaled to larger quantity structures by adding further automation systems or redundant OS server pairs.

Note

Derivation of the appropriate automation solution for a process plant is explained in more detail through an overview of typical questions in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual. Taking this overview into account is recommended for effective planning of the plant.

# 4.2.3 Hardware selection

# Recommended hardware configuration

The PC hardware should correspond to the recommended hardware configuration, which is described in the supplied ""PCS 7 Readme"" documentation for the PCS 7 version to be installed.

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2. Refer to the hardware compatibility matrix in the ""PCS 7 Readme V9.0"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109744312) document in this regard.

Various configurations are available for PCS 7. The technical requirements, e.g. support for a large number of client connections as well for compatibility, dictate the possible operating systems for the PCS 7 application.

The following operating systems were used in connection with an Industrial Workstation IPC for the example configuration:

- OS server: Windows Server 2012 R2
- Engineering system (ES): Windows Server 2012 R2
- OS clients: Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB

# 4.2.5 Naming concept

Rules for computer names

The selection of the computer name is crucial to the project configuration. Select short and descriptive computer names that provide some information about the function of the PC station in the overall plant. Note the following rules:

- The computer name may only contain uppercase letters and numbers.
- The computer name must start with a letter.
- The computer name may only contain up to 15 characters (limited by the operating system).

Note

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

The concept presented consists of the following components:

- 1 engineering station (ES): Central station for configuring the complete automation solution.
- 2 automation systems (AS 410S and AS 410H): for automation of two plant areas, for example, ""Reactor 1"" and ""Reactor 2"".
- 1 OS server with redundant OS server as a partner station for providing the process pictures and process data for operating the plant.
- 4 OS clients for centralized and decentralized process operation.

This structure can be easily scaled to larger quantity structures by adding further automation systems or redundant OS server pairs.

Note

Derivation of the appropriate automation solution for a process plant is explained in more detail through an overview of typical questions in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual. Taking this overview into account is recommended for effective planning of the plant.

# 4.2.3 Hardware selection

# Recommended hardware configuration

The PC hardware should correspond to the recommended hardware configuration, which is described in the supplied ""PCS 7 Readme"" documentation for the PCS 7 version to be installed.

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2. Refer to the hardware compatibility matrix in the ""PCS 7 Readme V9.0"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109744312) document in this regard.

# 4.2.4 Operating system selection

Various configurations are available for PCS 7. The technical requirements, e.g. support for a large number of client connections as well for compatibility, dictate the possible operating systems for the PCS 7 application.

The following operating systems were used in connection with an Industrial Workstation IPC for the example configuration:

- OS server: Windows Server 2012 R2
- Engineering system (ES): Windows Server 2012 R2
- OS clients: Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB

Note
You can find an overview of the supported operating systems and PCS 7 configurations in the ""Compatibility list PCS 7 configurations and operating systems"" in PCS 7 Readme. Likewise, you can use the compatibility tool (www.siemens.com/kompatool) to check individual PCS 7 applications and operating systems for compatibility.

# 4.2.5 Naming concept

Rules for computer names

The selection of the computer name is crucial to the project configuration. Select short and descriptive computer names that provide some information about the function of the PC station in the overall plant. Note the following rules:

- The computer name may only contain uppercase letters and numbers.
- The computer name must start with a letter.
- The computer name may only contain up to 15 characters (limited by the operating system).

Note
The following names must be identical when you configure an OS or BATCH Server and an Engineering Station:

# 4.2.3 Hardware selection

# Recommended hardware configuration

The PC hardware should correspond to the recommended hardware configuration, which is described in the supplied ""PCS 7 Readme"" documentation for the PCS 7 version to be installed.

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2.

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

The concept presented consists of the following components:

- 1 engineering station (ES): Central station for configuring the complete automation solution.
- 2 automation systems (AS 410S and AS 410H): for automation of two plant areas, for example, ""Reactor 1"" and ""Reactor 2"".
- 1 OS server with redundant OS server as a partner station for providing the process pictures and process data for operating the plant.
- 4 OS clients for centralized and decentralized process operation.

This structure can be easily scaled to larger quantity structures by adding further automation systems or redundant OS server pairs.

Note

Derivation of the appropriate automation solution for a process plant is explained in more detail through an overview of typical questions in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual. Taking this overview into account is recommended for effective planning of the plant.

# 4.2.3 Hardware selection

# Recommended hardware configuration

The PC hardware should correspond to the recommended hardware configuration, which is described in the supplied ""PCS 7 Readme"" documentation for the PCS 7 version to be installed.

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2.

# 4.2.2 Plant concept

Introduction

The following plant concept is used in this documentation as an example for implementing process automation:

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

The concept presented consists of the following components:

- 1 engineering station (ES): Central station for configuring the complete automation solution.
- 2 automation systems (AS 410S and AS 410H): for automation of two plant areas, for example, ""Reactor 1"" and ""Reactor 2"".
- 1 OS server with redundant OS server as a partner station for providing the process pictures and process data for operating the plant.
- 4 OS clients for centralized and decentralized process operation.

This structure can be easily scaled to larger quantity structures by adding further automation systems or redundant OS server pairs.

Note

Derivation of the appropriate automation solution for a process plant is explained in more detail through an overview of typical questions in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual. Taking this overview into account is recommended for effective planning of the plant.

# 4.2.3 Hardware selection

# Recommended hardware configuration

The PC hardware should correspond to the recommended hardware configuration, which is described in the supplied ""PCS 7 Readme"" documentation for the PCS 7 version to be installed.

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2. Refer to the hardware compatibility matrix in the ""PCS 7 Readme V9.0"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109744312) document in this regard.

The selection of the computer name is crucial to the project configuration. Select short and descriptive computer names that provide some information about the function of the PC station in the overall plant. Note the following rules:

- The computer name may only contain uppercase letters and numbers.
- The computer name must start with a letter.
- The computer name may only contain up to 15 characters (limited by the operating system).

Note

However, it is not only creation of the PCS 7 solution that is defined and regulated with these guidelines. They also form a very good basis for all future work on a PCS 7 plant and provide consistent quality over the plant's entire lifecycle.

The following specifications must be observed:

- User Requirement Specification (URS)
- Functional Specification (FS)
- Design Specification (DS)

The test documents used for reviewing and documenting adherence to the specifications are just as important:

- Factory Acceptance Test (FAT), also known as Installation Qualification (IQ)
- Site Acceptance Test (SAT) also known as Operational Qualification (OQ)
- Performance Qualification (PQ)

These documents are used for quality assurance purposes during a plant's entire lifecycle. The PCS 7 compendia should be taken into account for the design guidelines and test specifications.

# 4.2.2 Plant concept

Introduction

The following plant concept is used in this documentation as an example for implementing process automation:

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

The concept presented consists of the following components:

- 1 engineering station (ES): Central station for configuring the complete automation solution.
- 2 automation systems (AS 410S and AS 410H): for automation of two plant areas, for example, ""Reactor 1"" and ""Reactor 2"".
- 1 OS server with redundant OS server as a partner station for providing the process pictures and process data for operating the plant.
- 4 OS clients for centralized and decentralized process operation.

This structure can be easily scaled to larger quantity structures by adding further automation systems or redundant OS server pairs.

Note

Derivation of the appropriate automation solution for a process plant is explained in more detail through an overview of typical questions in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual. Taking this overview into account is recommended for effective planning of the plant.

# 4.2.3 Hardware selection

# Recommended hardware configuration

The PC hardware should correspond to the recommended hardware configuration, which is described in the supplied ""PCS 7 Readme"" documentation for the PCS 7 version to be installed.

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2. Refer to the hardware compatibility matrix in the ""PCS 7 Readme V9.0"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109744312) document in this regard.

# 4.2.4 Operating system selection

Various configurations are available for PCS 7. The technical requirements, e.g. support for a large number of client connections as well for compatibility, dictate the possible operating systems for the PCS 7 application.

The following operating systems were used in connection with an Industrial Workstation IPC for the example configuration:

- OS server: Windows Server 2012 R2
- Engineering system (ES): Windows Server 2012 R2
- OS clients: Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB

# 4.2.5 Naming concept

Rules for computer names

The selection of the computer name is crucial to the project configuration. Select short and descriptive computer names that provide some information about the function of the PC station in the overall plant. Note the following rules:

- The computer name may only contain uppercase letters and numbers.
- The computer name must start with a letter.
- The computer name may only contain up to 15 characters (limited by the operating system).

Note

The following plant concept is used in this documentation as an example for implementing process automation:

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

The concept presented consists of the following components:

- 1 engineering station (ES): Central station for configuring the complete automation solution.
- 2 automation systems (AS 410S and AS 410H): for automation of two plant areas, for example, ""Reactor 1"" and ""Reactor 2"".
- 1 OS server with redundant OS server as a partner station for providing the process pictures and process data for operating the plant.
- 4 OS clients for centralized and decentralized process operation.

This structure can be easily scaled to larger quantity structures by adding further automation systems or redundant OS server pairs.

Note

Derivation of the appropriate automation solution for a process plant is explained in more detail through an overview of typical questions in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual. Taking this overview into account is recommended for effective planning of the plant.

# 4.2.3 Hardware selection

# Recommended hardware configuration

The PC hardware should correspond to the recommended hardware configuration, which is described in the supplied ""PCS 7 Readme"" documentation for the PCS 7 version to be installed.

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2. Refer to the hardware compatibility matrix in the ""PCS 7 Readme V9.0"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109744312) document in this regard.

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

# 4.2.4 Operating system selection

Various configurations are available for PCS 7. The technical requirements, e.g. support for a large number of client connections as well for compatibility, dictate the possible operating systems for the PCS 7 application.

The following operating systems were used in connection with an Industrial Workstation IPC for the example configuration:

- OS server: Windows Server 2012 R2
- Engineering system (ES): Windows Server 2012 R2
- OS clients: Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB

Note
You can find an overview of the supported operating systems and PCS 7 configurations in the ""Compatibility list PCS 7 configurations and operating systems"" in PCS 7 Readme. Likewise, you can use the compatibility tool (www.siemens.com/kompatool) to check individual PCS 7 applications and operating systems for compatibility.

# 4.2.5 Naming concept

Rules for computer names

The selection of the computer name is crucial to the project configuration. Select short and descriptive computer names that provide some information about the function of the PC station in the overall plant. Note the following rules:

- The computer name may only contain uppercase letters and numbers.
- The computer name must start with a letter.
- The computer name may only contain up to 15 characters (limited by the operating system).

Note
The following names must be identical when you configure an OS or BATCH Server and an Engineering Station:

- Computer name
- Name of the PC station

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2.

Introduction

The following plant concept is used in this documentation as an example for implementing process automation:

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

The concept presented consists of the following components:

- 1 engineering station (ES): Central station for configuring the complete automation solution.
- 2 automation systems (AS 410S and AS 410H): for automation of two plant areas, for example, ""Reactor 1"" and ""Reactor 2"".
- 1 OS server with redundant OS server as a partner station for providing the process pictures and process data for operating the plant.
- 4 OS clients for centralized and decentralized process operation.

This structure can be easily scaled to larger quantity structures by adding further automation systems or redundant OS server pairs.

Note

Derivation of the appropriate automation solution for a process plant is explained in more detail through an overview of typical questions in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual. Taking this overview into account is recommended for effective planning of the plant.

# 4.2.3 Hardware selection

# Recommended hardware configuration

The PC hardware should correspond to the recommended hardware configuration, which is described in the supplied ""PCS 7 Readme"" documentation for the PCS 7 version to be installed.

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2. Refer to the hardware compatibility matrix in the ""PCS 7 Readme V9.0"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109744312) document in this regard.

However, it is not only creation of the PCS 7 solution that is defined and regulated with these guidelines. They also form a very good basis for all future work on a PCS 7 plant and provide consistent quality over the plant's entire lifecycle.

The following specifications must be observed:

- User Requirement Specification (URS)
- Functional Specification (FS)
- Design Specification (DS)

The test documents used for reviewing and documenting adherence to the specifications are just as important:

- Factory Acceptance Test (FAT), also known as Installation Qualification (IQ)
- Site Acceptance Test (SAT) also known as Operational Qualification (OQ)
- Performance Qualification (PQ)

These documents are used for quality assurance purposes during a plant's entire lifecycle. The PCS 7 compendia should be taken into account for the design guidelines and test specifications.

# 4.2.2 Plant concept

Introduction

The following plant concept is used in this documentation as an example for implementing process automation:

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

The concept presented consists of the following components:

- 1 engineering station (ES): Central station for configuring the complete automation solution.
- 2 automation systems (AS 410S and AS 410H): for automation of two plant areas, for example, ""Reactor 1"" and ""Reactor 2"".
- 1 OS server with redundant OS server as a partner station for providing the process pictures and process data for operating the plant.
- 4 OS clients for centralized and decentralized process operation.

This structure can be easily scaled to larger quantity structures by adding further automation systems or redundant OS server pairs.

Note

Derivation of the appropriate automation solution for a process plant is explained in more detail through an overview of typical questions in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual. Taking this overview into account is recommended for effective planning of the plant.

# 4.2.3 Hardware selection

# Recommended hardware configuration

The PC hardware should correspond to the recommended hardware configuration, which is described in the supplied ""PCS 7 Readme"" documentation for the PCS 7 version to be installed.

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2. Refer to the hardware compatibility matrix in the ""PCS 7 Readme V9.0"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109744312) document in this regard.

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

# 4.2.4 Operating system selection

Various configurations are available for PCS 7. The technical requirements, e.g. support for a large number of client connections as well for compatibility, dictate the possible operating systems for the PCS 7 application.

The following operating systems were used in connection with an Industrial Workstation IPC for the example configuration:

- OS server: Windows Server 2012 R2
- Engineering system (ES): Windows Server 2012 R2
- OS clients: Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB

Note
You can find an overview of the supported operating systems and PCS 7 configurations in the ""Compatibility list PCS 7 configurations and operating systems"" in PCS 7 Readme. Likewise, you can use the compatibility tool (www.siemens.com/kompatool) to check individual PCS 7 applications and operating systems for compatibility.

# 4.2.5 Naming concept

Rules for computer names

The selection of the computer name is crucial to the project configuration. Select short and descriptive computer names that provide some information about the function of the PC station in the overall plant. Note the following rules:

- The computer name may only contain uppercase letters and numbers.
- The computer name must start with a letter.
- The computer name may only contain up to 15 characters (limited by the operating system).

Note
The following names must be identical when you configure an OS or BATCH Server and an Engineering Station:

However, it is not only creation of the PCS 7 solution that is defined and regulated with these guidelines. They also form a very good basis for all future work on a PCS 7 plant and provide consistent quality over the plant's entire lifecycle.

The following specifications must be observed:

- User Requirement Specification (URS)
- Functional Specification (FS)
- Design Specification (DS)

The test documents used for reviewing and documenting adherence to the specifications are just as important:

- Factory Acceptance Test (FAT), also known as Installation Qualification (IQ)
- Site Acceptance Test (SAT) also known as Operational Qualification (OQ)
- Performance Qualification (PQ)

These documents are used for quality assurance purposes during a plant's entire lifecycle. The PCS 7 compendia should be taken into account for the design guidelines and test specifications.

# 4.2.2 Plant concept

Introduction

The following plant concept is used in this documentation as an example for implementing process automation:

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

The concept presented consists of the following components:

- 1 engineering station (ES): Central station for configuring the complete automation solution.
- 2 automation systems (AS 410S and AS 410H): for automation of two plant areas, for example, ""Reactor 1"" and ""Reactor 2"".
- 1 OS server with redundant OS server as a partner station for providing the process pictures and process data for operating the plant.
- 4 OS clients for centralized and decentralized process operation.

This structure can be easily scaled to larger quantity structures by adding further automation systems or redundant OS server pairs.

Note

Derivation of the appropriate automation solution for a process plant is explained in more detail through an overview of typical questions in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual. Taking this overview into account is recommended for effective planning of the plant.

# 4.2.3 Hardware selection

# Recommended hardware configuration

The PC hardware should correspond to the recommended hardware configuration, which is described in the supplied ""PCS 7 Readme"" documentation for the PCS 7 version to be installed.

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2. Refer to the hardware compatibility matrix in the ""PCS 7 Readme V9.0"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109744312) document in this regard.

# 4.2.4 Operating system selection

Various configurations are available for PCS 7. The technical requirements, e.g. support for a large number of client connections as well for compatibility, dictate the possible operating systems for the PCS 7 application.

The following operating systems were used in connection with an Industrial Workstation IPC for the example configuration:

- OS server: Windows Server 2012 R2
- Engineering system (ES): Windows Server 2012 R2
- OS clients: Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB

Likewise, you can use the compatibility tool (www.siemens.com/kompatool) to check individual PCS 7 applications and operating systems for compatibility.

# 4.2.5 Naming concept

Rules for computer names

The selection of the computer name is crucial to the project configuration. Select short and descriptive computer names that provide some information about the function of the PC station in the overall plant. Note the following rules:

- The computer name may only contain uppercase letters and numbers.
- The computer name must start with a letter.
- The computer name may only contain up to 15 characters (limited by the operating system).

Note
The following names must be identical when you configure an OS or BATCH Server and an Engineering Station:

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

The concept presented consists of the following components:

- 1 engineering station (ES): Central station for configuring the complete automation solution.
- 2 automation systems (AS 410S and AS 410H): for automation of two plant areas, for example, ""Reactor 1"" and ""Reactor 2"".
- 1 OS server with redundant OS server as a partner station for providing the process pictures and process data for operating the plant.
- 4 OS clients for centralized and decentralized process operation.

This structure can be easily scaled to larger quantity structures by adding further automation systems or redundant OS server pairs.

Note

Derivation of the appropriate automation solution for a process plant is explained in more detail through an overview of typical questions in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual. Taking this overview into account is recommended for effective planning of the plant.

# 4.2.3 Hardware selection

# Recommended hardware configuration

The PC hardware should correspond to the recommended hardware configuration, which is described in the supplied ""PCS 7 Readme"" documentation for the PCS 7 version to be installed.

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2. Refer to the hardware compatibility matrix in the ""PCS 7 Readme V9.0"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109744312) document in this regard.

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

# 4.2.4 Operating system selection

Various configurations are available for PCS 7. The technical requirements, e.g. support for a large number of client connections as well for compatibility, dictate the possible operating systems for the PCS 7 application.

The following operating systems were used in connection with an Industrial Workstation IPC for the example configuration:

- OS server: Windows Server 2012 R2
- Engineering system (ES): Windows Server 2012 R2
- OS clients: Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB

Note
You can find an overview of the supported operating systems and PCS 7 configurations in the ""Compatibility list PCS 7 configurations and operating systems"" in PCS 7 Readme. Likewise, you can use the compatibility tool (www.siemens.com/kompatool) to check individual PCS 7 applications and operating systems for compatibility.

# 4.2.5 Naming concept

Rules for computer names

The selection of the computer name is crucial to the project configuration. Select short and descriptive computer names that provide some information about the function of the PC station in the overall plant. Note the following rules:

- The computer name may only contain uppercase letters and numbers.
- The computer name must start with a letter.
- The computer name may only contain up to 15 characters (limited by the operating system).

Note
The following names must be identical when you configure an OS or BATCH Server and an Engineering Station:

- Computer name
- Name of the PC station
