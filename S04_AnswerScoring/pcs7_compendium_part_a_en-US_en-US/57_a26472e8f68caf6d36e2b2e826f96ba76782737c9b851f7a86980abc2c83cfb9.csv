NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

Note

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

The following procedure shows the configuration of the DP interface using the example of the CP 443-5 Ext.

1. Open the properties dialog of the CP 443-5 Ext in HW Config.

Note

Always assign address 2 to the CP 443-5 Extended as the PROFIBUS master. Address 1 should be reserved for connecting a programming device to the PROFIBUS for servicing purposes. Address 0 is reserved for connection of the ES to the PROFIBUS.

4. You can make the network settings for each PROFIBUS network. The default profile ""DP"" is suitable for most applications, e.g. networks in line structures. A user-defined profile is required depending on the DP slaves used or the use of optical rings via PROFIBUS OLM. Set the transmission rate depending on the connected DP slaves and the length of the PROFIBUS segment. The default transmission speed of 1.5 Mbps can be adjusted in individual cases.

5. Use the ""Options"" and ""Take into account the following cable configuration"" buttons to add your bus architecture to the configuration and thereby optimize the DP bus parameters for your process.

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

1. Open the properties dialog of the CP 443-5 Ext in HW Config.

Note

Always assign address 2 to the CP 443-5 Extended as the PROFIBUS master. Address 1 should be reserved for connecting a programming device to the PROFIBUS for servicing purposes. Address 0 is reserved for connection of the ES to the PROFIBUS.

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

Note

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

The following procedure shows the configuration of the DP interface using the example of the CP 443-5 Ext.

1. Open the properties dialog of the CP 443-5 Ext in HW Config.

Note

Always assign address 2 to the CP 443-5 Extended as the PROFIBUS master. Address 1 should be reserved for connecting a programming device to the PROFIBUS for servicing purposes. Address 0 is reserved for connection of the ES to the PROFIBUS.

4. You can make the network settings for each PROFIBUS network. The default profile ""DP"" is suitable for most applications, e.g. networks in line structures. A user-defined profile is required depending on the DP slaves used or the use of optical rings via PROFIBUS OLM. Set the transmission rate depending on the connected DP slaves and the length of the PROFIBUS segment. The default transmission speed of 1.5 Mbps can be adjusted in individual cases.

5. Use the ""Options"" and ""Take into account the following cable configuration"" buttons to add your bus architecture to the configuration and thereby optimize the DP bus parameters for your process.

In the event that monitoring times which are set too low prevent redundant operation during a plant conversion (e.g. through configured DP slaves that cannot be reached, the update will take longer than 800 ms), the times can be increased and updated during operation.

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

Note

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

The following procedure shows the configuration of the DP interface using the example of the CP 443-5 Ext.

1. Open the properties dialog of the CP 443-5 Ext in HW Config.

Note

Always assign address 2 to the CP 443-5 Extended as the PROFIBUS master. Address 1 should be reserved for connecting a programming device to the PROFIBUS for servicing purposes. Address 0 is reserved for connection of the ES to the PROFIBUS.

4. You can make the network settings for each PROFIBUS network. The default profile ""DP"" is suitable for most applications, e.g. networks in line structures. A user-defined profile is required depending on the DP slaves used or the use of optical rings via PROFIBUS OLM. Set the transmission rate depending on the connected DP slaves and the length of the PROFIBUS segment. The default transmission speed of 1.5 Mbps can be adjusted in individual cases.

5. Use the ""Options"" and ""Take into account the following cable configuration"" buttons to add your bus architecture to the configuration and thereby optimize the DP bus parameters for your process.

The default user program value settings (0,0,1024) provide the default monitoring times (8,000 ms, 3,200 ms, 800 ms, 70 ms). These values are already optimized for typical user cases meaning that no new calculation is required. In the event that monitoring times which are set too low prevent redundant operation during a plant conversion (e.g. through configured DP slaves that cannot be reached, the update will take longer than 800 ms), the times can be increased and updated during operation.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

Note

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

The following procedure shows the configuration of the DP interface using the example of the CP 443-5 Ext.

1. Open the properties dialog of the CP 443-5 Ext in HW Config.

Note

Always assign address 2 to the CP 443-5 Extended as the PROFIBUS master. Address 1 should be reserved for connecting a programming device to the PROFIBUS for servicing purposes. Address 0 is reserved for connection of the ES to the PROFIBUS.

4. You can make the network settings for each PROFIBUS network. The default profile ""DP"" is suitable for most applications, e.g. networks in line structures. A user-defined profile is required depending on the DP slaves used or the use of optical rings via PROFIBUS OLM. Set the transmission rate depending on the connected DP slaves and the length of the PROFIBUS segment. The default transmission speed of 1.5 Mbps can be adjusted in individual cases.

5. Use the ""Options"" and ""Take into account the following cable configuration"" buttons to add your bus architecture to the configuration and thereby optimize the DP bus parameters for your process.

The default user program value settings (0,0,1024) provide the default monitoring times (8,000 ms, 3,200 ms, 800 ms, 70 ms). These values are already optimized for typical user cases meaning that no new calculation is required. In the event that monitoring times which are set too low prevent redundant operation during a plant conversion (e.g. through configured DP slaves that cannot be reached, the update will take longer than 800 ms), the times can be increased and updated during operation.

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

Note

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

The following procedure shows the configuration of the DP interface using the example of the CP 443-5 Ext.

1. Open the properties dialog of the CP 443-5 Ext in HW Config.

Note

Always assign address 2 to the CP 443-5 Extended as the PROFIBUS master. Address 1 should be reserved for connecting a programming device to the PROFIBUS for servicing purposes. Address 0 is reserved for connection of the ES to the PROFIBUS.

4. You can make the network settings for each PROFIBUS network. The default profile ""DP"" is suitable for most applications, e.g. networks in line structures. A user-defined profile is required depending on the DP slaves used or the use of optical rings via PROFIBUS OLM. Set the transmission rate depending on the connected DP slaves and the length of the PROFIBUS segment. The default transmission speed of 1.5 Mbps can be adjusted in individual cases.

5. Use the ""Options"" and ""Take into account the following cable configuration"" buttons to add your bus architecture to the configuration and thereby optimize the DP bus parameters for your process.

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

Note

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

The following procedure shows the configuration of the DP interface using the example of the CP 443-5 Ext.

1. Open the properties dialog of the CP 443-5 Ext in HW Config.

Note

Always assign address 2 to the CP 443-5 Extended as the PROFIBUS master. Address 1 should be reserved for connecting a programming device to the PROFIBUS for servicing purposes. Address 0 is reserved for connection of the ES to the PROFIBUS.

4. You can make the network settings for each PROFIBUS network. The default profile ""DP"" is suitable for most applications, e.g. networks in line structures. A user-defined profile is required depending on the DP slaves used or the use of optical rings via PROFIBUS OLM. Set the transmission rate depending on the connected DP slaves and the length of the PROFIBUS segment. The default transmission speed of 1.5 Mbps can be adjusted in individual cases.

5. Use the ""Options"" and ""Take into account the following cable configuration"" buttons to add your bus architecture to the configuration and thereby optimize the DP bus parameters for your process.

These values are already optimized for typical user cases meaning that no new calculation is required. In the event that monitoring times which are set too low prevent redundant operation during a plant conversion (e.g. through configured DP slaves that cannot be reached, the update will take longer than 800 ms), the times can be increased and updated during operation.

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

1. Open the properties dialog of the CP 443-5 Ext in HW Config.

Note

Always assign address 2 to the CP 443-5 Extended as the PROFIBUS master. Address 1 should be reserved for connecting a programming device to the PROFIBUS for servicing purposes. Address 0 is reserved for connection of the ES to the PROFIBUS.

4. You can make the network settings for each PROFIBUS network. The default profile ""DP"" is suitable for most applications, e.g. networks in line structures. A user-defined profile is required depending on the DP slaves used or the use of optical rings via PROFIBUS OLM. Set the transmission rate depending on the connected DP slaves and the length of the PROFIBUS segment. The default transmission speed of 1.5 Mbps can be adjusted in individual cases.

5. Use the ""Options"" and ""Take into account the following cable configuration"" buttons to add your bus architecture to the configuration and thereby optimize the DP bus parameters for your process.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

Note

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

4. You can make the network settings for each PROFIBUS network. The default profile ""DP"" is suitable for most applications, e.g. networks in line structures. A user-defined profile is required depending on the DP slaves used or the use of optical rings via PROFIBUS OLM. Set the transmission rate depending on the connected DP slaves and the length of the PROFIBUS segment. The default transmission speed of 1.5 Mbps can be adjusted in individual cases.

5. Use the ""Options"" and ""Take into account the following cable configuration"" buttons to add your bus architecture to the configuration and thereby optimize the DP bus parameters for your process.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

4. You can make the network settings for each PROFIBUS network. The default profile ""DP"" is suitable for most applications, e.g. networks in line structures. A user-defined profile is required depending on the DP slaves used or the use of optical rings via PROFIBUS OLM. Set the transmission rate depending on the connected DP slaves and the length of the PROFIBUS segment. The default transmission speed of 1.5 Mbps can be adjusted in individual cases.

5. Use the ""Options"" and ""Take into account the following cable configuration"" buttons to add your bus architecture to the configuration and thereby optimize the DP bus parameters for your process.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

4. You can make the network settings for each PROFIBUS network. The default profile ""DP"" is suitable for most applications, e.g. networks in line structures. A user-defined profile is required depending on the DP slaves used or the use of optical rings via PROFIBUS OLM. Set the transmission rate depending on the connected DP slaves and the length of the PROFIBUS segment. The default transmission speed of 1.5 Mbps can be adjusted in individual cases.

5. Use the ""Options"" and ""Take into account the following cable configuration"" buttons to add your bus architecture to the configuration and thereby optimize the DP bus parameters for your process.

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

The following procedure shows the configuration of the DP interface using the example of the CP 443-5 Ext.

1. Open the properties dialog of the CP 443-5 Ext in HW Config.

Note

Always assign address 2 to the CP 443-5 Extended as the PROFIBUS master. Address 1 should be reserved for connecting a programming device to the PROFIBUS for servicing purposes. Address 0 is reserved for connection of the ES to the PROFIBUS.

The default user program value settings (0,0,1024) provide the default monitoring times (8,000 ms, 3,200 ms, 800 ms, 70 ms). These values are already optimized for typical user cases meaning that no new calculation is required. In the event that monitoring times which are set too low prevent redundant operation during a plant conversion (e.g. through configured DP slaves that cannot be reached, the update will take longer than 800 ms), the times can be increased and updated during operation.

# Configuration of the hardware (AS and I/O)

# 6.2 Special settings for H systems

Ascertain the length of time for the monitoring time taken when updating. The period for the update phase for transition to redundant operation is adhered to each time in the CPU diagnostics buffer. Look for the following event for this:

- Event 7 of 3000
- Event ID 16# 7303
- H system (1of2) gone into redundant operation
- Occurred in: Master CPU in rack no.: 0
- Start-up information:
- Start with no change in system expansion
- Update monitoring time in ms: 426

In order for the H system to transition to redundant operation the monitoring time displayed for updating must be less than the maximum inhibit time for priority classes >15.

# Redundant I/O

If redundant I/O modules are configured, ensure that the DB number set here does not conflict with the numbers of your user DBs.

Note: This setting is not relevant for the redundant I/O of the ET 200SP HA.

Note: You can find information on the use and configuration of redundant I/O in the following manuals:

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

Note

You can find more information about configuration in the ""PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the ""Data Record Routing"" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the ""Data Record Routing"" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

The following procedure shows the configuration of the DP interface using the example of the CP 443-5 Ext.

1. Open the properties dialog of the CP 443-5 Ext in HW Config.

Note

Always assign address 2 to the CP 443-5 Extended as the PROFIBUS master. Address 1 should be reserved for connecting a programming device to the PROFIBUS for servicing purposes. Address 0 is reserved for connection of the ES to the PROFIBUS.

4. You can make the network settings for each PROFIBUS network. The default profile ""DP"" is suitable for most applications, e.g. networks in line structures. A user-defined profile is required depending on the DP slaves used or the use of optical rings via PROFIBUS OLM. Set the transmission rate depending on the connected DP slaves and the length of the PROFIBUS segment. The default transmission speed of 1.5 Mbps can be adjusted in individual cases.

5. Use the ""Options"" and ""Take into account the following cable configuration"" buttons to add your bus architecture to the configuration and thereby optimize the DP bus parameters for your process.
