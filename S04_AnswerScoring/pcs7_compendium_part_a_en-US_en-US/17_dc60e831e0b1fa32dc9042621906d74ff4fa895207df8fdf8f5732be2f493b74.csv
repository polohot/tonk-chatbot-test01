2. Set the same work group for all PCS 7 stations where you are not using a domain structure.
3. Create the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files for the NETBIOS name resolution and distribute these files to all PCS 7 stations. The ""LMHOSTS"" file is located in the following file path in Windows: ""<Drive>\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\"".
4. In the ""LMHOSTS"" file use the parameter #PRE for each computer name to be entered so that this name is entered into the so-called NETBIOS cache when the computer is booted up. (The cache can be displayed via the command line using the ""nbtstat –c"" command)

Checking the availability of communication partners

Once the network settings for the terminal bus are completed, you can use the SIMATIC Shell tool on each station to check if the required partner stations (ES, OS server, and OS clients) can be seen on the terminal bus. SIMATIC Shell is available as a folder in the workspace of the Windows Explorer.

If there is no required partner station in SIMATIC Shell, it may indicate that the TCP/IP name resolution is poorly set. There are several concepts for a TCP/IP network in this regard, beginning with the editing of the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files and continuing with the use of WINS/DNS servers.

Checking the availability of communication partners

Once the network settings for the terminal bus are completed, you can use the SIMATIC Shell tool on each station to check if the required partner stations (ES, OS server, and OS clients) can be seen on the terminal bus. SIMATIC Shell is available as a folder in the workspace of the Windows Explorer.

If there is no required partner station in SIMATIC Shell, it may indicate that the TCP/IP name resolution is poorly set. There are several concepts for a TCP/IP network in this regard, beginning with the editing of the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files and continuing with the use of WINS/DNS servers.

1. Ensure that the energy-saving option is switched off in the network card properties.
2. Set the same work group for all PCS 7 stations where you are not using a domain structure.
3. Create the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files for the NETBIOS name resolution and distribute these files to all PCS 7 stations. The ""LMHOSTS"" file is located in the following file path in Windows: ""<Drive>\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\"".
4. In the ""LMHOSTS"" file use the parameter #PRE for each computer name to be entered so that this name is entered into the so-called NETBIOS cache when the computer is booted up. (The cache can be displayed via the command line using the ""nbtstat –c"" command)

Checking the availability of communication partners

Once the network settings for the terminal bus are completed, you can use the SIMATIC Shell tool on each station to check if the required partner stations (ES, OS server, and OS clients) can be seen on the terminal bus. SIMATIC Shell is available as a folder in the workspace of the Windows Explorer.

If there is no required partner station in SIMATIC Shell, it may indicate that the TCP/IP name resolution is poorly set. There are several concepts for a TCP/IP network in this regard, beginning with the editing of the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files and continuing with the use of WINS/DNS servers.

If there is no required partner station in SIMATIC Shell, it may indicate that the TCP/IP name resolution is poorly set. There are several concepts for a TCP/IP network in this regard, beginning with the editing of the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files and continuing with the use of WINS/DNS servers.

Checking the availability of communication partners

Once the network settings for the terminal bus are completed, you can use the SIMATIC Shell tool on each station to check if the required partner stations (ES, OS server, and OS clients) can be seen on the terminal bus. SIMATIC Shell is available as a folder in the workspace of the Windows Explorer.

If there is no required partner station in SIMATIC Shell, it may indicate that the TCP/IP name resolution is poorly set. There are several concepts for a TCP/IP network in this regard, beginning with the editing of the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files and continuing with the use of WINS/DNS servers.

2. Set the same work group for all PCS 7 stations where you are not using a domain structure.
3. Create the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files for the NETBIOS name resolution and distribute these files to all PCS 7 stations. The ""LMHOSTS"" file is located in the following file path in Windows: ""<Drive>\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\"".
4. In the ""LMHOSTS"" file use the parameter #PRE for each computer name to be entered so that this name is entered into the so-called NETBIOS cache when the computer is booted up. (The cache can be displayed via the command line using the ""nbtstat –c"" command)

Checking the availability of communication partners

Once the network settings for the terminal bus are completed, you can use the SIMATIC Shell tool on each station to check if the required partner stations (ES, OS server, and OS clients) can be seen on the terminal bus. SIMATIC Shell is available as a folder in the workspace of the Windows Explorer.

If there is no required partner station in SIMATIC Shell, it may indicate that the TCP/IP name resolution is poorly set. There are several concepts for a TCP/IP network in this regard, beginning with the editing of the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files and continuing with the use of WINS/DNS servers.

Checking the availability of communication partners

Once the network settings for the terminal bus are completed, you can use the SIMATIC Shell tool on each station to check if the required partner stations (ES, OS server, and OS clients) can be seen on the terminal bus. SIMATIC Shell is available as a folder in the workspace of the Windows Explorer.

If there is no required partner station in SIMATIC Shell, it may indicate that the TCP/IP name resolution is poorly set. There are several concepts for a TCP/IP network in this regard, beginning with the editing of the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files and continuing with the use of WINS/DNS servers.

1. Ensure that the energy-saving option is switched off in the network card properties.
2. Set the same work group for all PCS 7 stations where you are not using a domain structure.
3. Create the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files for the NETBIOS name resolution and distribute these files to all PCS 7 stations. The ""LMHOSTS"" file is located in the following file path in Windows: ""<Drive>\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\"".
4. In the ""LMHOSTS"" file use the parameter #PRE for each computer name to be entered so that this name is entered into the so-called NETBIOS cache when the computer is booted up. (The cache can be displayed via the command line using the ""nbtstat –c"" command)

You can find additional information on the setup, management and protection of network structures such as workgroups and domains in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Security Concept PCS 7 & WinCC (Basic)"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/60119725) document. After installation of the operating system, the ""public network"" network profile is configured by default for the network connections, which is not released for the terminal bus in PCS 7. You can find information on the connection to the terminal bus in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 - PC Configuration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual (""How to set up a work group for connection to the terminal bus"" section).

NOTICE

In the case of logical network segmentation using a subnet mask based on the same physical network (shared plant and terminal bus), the ""Internet protocol version 6 (TCP/IPv6)"" check box must be cleared. IPv6 should not be deactivated using the check box in the properties of the ""Internet protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)"".

Checking the availability of communication partners

Once the network settings for the terminal bus are completed, you can use the SIMATIC Shell tool on each station to check if the required partner stations (ES, OS server, and OS clients) can be seen on the terminal bus. SIMATIC Shell is available as a folder in the workspace of the Windows Explorer.

If there is no required partner station in SIMATIC Shell, it may indicate that the TCP/IP name resolution is poorly set. There are several concepts for a TCP/IP network in this regard, beginning with the editing of the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files and continuing with the use of WINS/DNS servers.
