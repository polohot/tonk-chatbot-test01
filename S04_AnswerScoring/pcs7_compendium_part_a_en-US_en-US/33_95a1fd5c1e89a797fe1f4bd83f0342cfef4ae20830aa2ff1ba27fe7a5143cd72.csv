In PCS 7 V6.1 and above the ""Assign CPU-oriented unique message numbers"" option is the default setting. This ensures that S7 programs are copied without changes being made to the message numbers.

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

Division into individual projects for multiproject engineering

Dividing the multiproject into functional units is recommended in principle in PCS 7 (e.g. one project per unit). This setup provides the maximum flexibility during the configuration and commissioning phase. This applies in particular to automation systems (AS). This way the configuring engineer responsible for one or more automation systems (AS) can, for example, uncouple the appropriate project from the multiproject and configure this project separately.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

The multiproject (""Comp_MP"" in the following example) should consist of the following parts:

- Project ""01_PLANT_A"" for a unit consisting of fault-tolerant AS
- Project ""02_PLANT_B"" for a unit consisting of standard AS
- Project ""25_ES"" for one or more engineering stations
- Project ""20_OS"" for the redundant OS server pair and an OS client
- Project ""21_CL"", for OS clients of the same type as typical operator stations
- Master data library ""Comp_Lib""

The division of the multiproject into various projects is determined by technological and local circumstances, as well as by specific project factors, such as the number of project engineers or the delineation of responsibilities.

Note

When PROFINET is used, it must be ensured when dividing the multiproject into individual projects that all stations that share a PROFINET network are in the same project. The functions of HW Config, e.g. topology configuration (automatic commissioning), can then be used.

You can find additional information on PROFINET in SIMATIC PCS 7 in the ""PROFINET in SIMATIC PCS 7 – Guidelines and Blueprints"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082) application example.

Note

A redundant OS server pair must always be created in the same project. Referenced operator stations must be created in the same project as the reference.

In PCS 7 V6.1 and above the ""Assign CPU-oriented unique message numbers"" option is the default setting. This ensures that S7 programs are copied without changes being made to the message numbers.

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

Division into individual projects for multiproject engineering

Dividing the multiproject into functional units is recommended in principle in PCS 7 (e.g. one project per unit). This setup provides the maximum flexibility during the configuration and commissioning phase. This applies in particular to automation systems (AS). This way the configuring engineer responsible for one or more automation systems (AS) can, for example, uncouple the appropriate project from the multiproject and configure this project separately.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

The multiproject (""Comp_MP"" in the following example) should consist of the following parts:

- Project ""01_PLANT_A"" for a unit consisting of fault-tolerant AS
- Project ""02_PLANT_B"" for a unit consisting of standard AS
- Project ""25_ES"" for one or more engineering stations
- Project ""20_OS"" for the redundant OS server pair and an OS client
- Project ""21_CL"", for OS clients of the same type as typical operator stations
- Master data library ""Comp_Lib""

The division of the multiproject into various projects is determined by technological and local circumstances, as well as by specific project factors, such as the number of project engineers or the delineation of responsibilities.

Note

When PROFINET is used, it must be ensured when dividing the multiproject into individual projects that all stations that share a PROFINET network are in the same project. The functions of HW Config, e.g. topology configuration (automatic commissioning), can then be used.

Note

A redundant OS server pair must always be created in the same project. Referenced operator stations must be created in the same project as the reference.

In PCS 7 V6.1 and above the ""Assign CPU-oriented unique message numbers"" option is the default setting. This ensures that S7 programs are copied without changes being made to the message numbers.

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

Division into individual projects for multiproject engineering

Dividing the multiproject into functional units is recommended in principle in PCS 7 (e.g. one project per unit). This setup provides the maximum flexibility during the configuration and commissioning phase. This applies in particular to automation systems (AS). This way the configuring engineer responsible for one or more automation systems (AS) can, for example, uncouple the appropriate project from the multiproject and configure this project separately.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

The multiproject (""Comp_MP"" in the following example) should consist of the following parts:

- Project ""01_PLANT_A"" for a unit consisting of fault-tolerant AS
- Project ""02_PLANT_B"" for a unit consisting of standard AS
- Project ""25_ES"" for one or more engineering stations
- Project ""20_OS"" for the redundant OS server pair and an OS client
- Project ""21_CL"", for OS clients of the same type as typical operator stations
- Master data library ""Comp_Lib""

The division of the multiproject into various projects is determined by technological and local circumstances, as well as by specific project factors, such as the number of project engineers or the delineation of responsibilities.

Note

When PROFINET is used, it must be ensured when dividing the multiproject into individual projects that all stations that share a PROFINET network are in the same project. The functions of HW Config, e.g. topology configuration (automatic commissioning), can then be used.

You can find additional information on PROFINET in SIMATIC PCS 7 in the ""PROFINET in SIMATIC PCS 7 – Guidelines and Blueprints"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082) application example.

Note

A redundant OS server pair must always be created in the same project. Referenced operator stations must be created in the same project as the reference.

In PCS 7 V6.1 and above the ""Assign CPU-oriented unique message numbers"" option is the default setting. This ensures that S7 programs are copied without changes being made to the message numbers.

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

Division into individual projects for multiproject engineering

Dividing the multiproject into functional units is recommended in principle in PCS 7 (e.g. one project per unit). This setup provides the maximum flexibility during the configuration and commissioning phase. This applies in particular to automation systems (AS). This way the configuring engineer responsible for one or more automation systems (AS) can, for example, uncouple the appropriate project from the multiproject and configure this project separately.

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

The multiproject (""Comp_MP"" in the following example) should consist of the following parts:

- Project ""01_PLANT_A"" for a unit consisting of fault-tolerant AS
- Project ""02_PLANT_B"" for a unit consisting of standard AS
- Project ""25_ES"" for one or more engineering stations
- Project ""20_OS"" for the redundant OS server pair and an OS client
- Project ""21_CL"", for OS clients of the same type as typical operator stations
- Master data library ""Comp_Lib""

The division of the multiproject into various projects is determined by technological and local circumstances, as well as by specific project factors, such as the number of project engineers or the delineation of responsibilities.

Message numbers

In PCS 7 V6.1 and above the ""Assign CPU-oriented unique message numbers"" option is the default setting. This ensures that S7 programs are copied without changes being made to the message numbers.

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

Division into individual projects for multiproject engineering

Dividing the multiproject into functional units is recommended in principle in PCS 7 (e.g. one project per unit). This setup provides the maximum flexibility during the configuration and commissioning phase. This applies in particular to automation systems (AS). This way the configuring engineer responsible for one or more automation systems (AS) can, for example, uncouple the appropriate project from the multiproject and configure this project separately.

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

The multiproject (""Comp_MP"" in the following example) should consist of the following parts:

- Project ""01_PLANT_A"" for a unit consisting of fault-tolerant AS
- Project ""02_PLANT_B"" for a unit consisting of standard AS
- Project ""25_ES"" for one or more engineering stations
- Project ""20_OS"" for the redundant OS server pair and an OS client
- Project ""21_CL"", for OS clients of the same type as typical operator stations
- Master data library ""Comp_Lib""

The division of the multiproject into various projects is determined by technological and local circumstances, as well as by specific project factors, such as the number of project engineers or the delineation of responsibilities.

Note

When PROFINET is used, it must be ensured when dividing the multiproject into individual projects that all stations that share a PROFINET network are in the same project. The functions of HW Config, e.g. topology configuration (automatic commissioning), can then be used.

You can find additional information on PROFINET in SIMATIC PCS 7 in the ""PROFINET in SIMATIC PCS 7 – Guidelines and Blueprints"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082) application example.

Note

A redundant OS server pair must always be created in the same project. Referenced operator stations must be created in the same project as the reference.
