# 6.2 Special settings for H systems

The following images shows the default settings on the ""H Parameters"" tab:

# Parameters for the advanced CPU test

""Reaction to RAM/PAA comparison error"" should remain set to the ""TROUBLESHOOTING"" operating mode. The H CPU offers a function for detecting a memory error, fixing simple memory errors, and automatically returning to the ""RUN redundant"" system mode.

# Update of the reserve

The reserve CPU is updated each time an H system goes from the ""RUN solo mode"" to ""RUN redundant"" system mode. This process is often referred to as ""link-up and update"". In the link-up phase, the CPU in RUN copies all blocks to the stopped CPU. In the update phase, the data block values that have changed since copying are updated.

You can find detailed information about link-up and update in the following manuals:

""Reaction to RAM/PAA comparison error"" should remain set to the ""TROUBLESHOOTING"" operating mode. The H CPU offers a function for detecting a memory error, fixing simple memory errors, and automatically returning to the ""RUN redundant"" system mode.

# Update of the reserve

The reserve CPU is updated each time an H system goes from the ""RUN solo mode"" to ""RUN redundant"" system mode. This process is often referred to as ""link-up and update"". In the link-up phase, the CPU in RUN copies all blocks to the stopped CPU. In the update phase, the data block values that have changed since copying are updated.

# 6.2 Special settings for H systems

The following images shows the default settings on the ""H Parameters"" tab:

# Parameters for the advanced CPU test

""Reaction to RAM/PAA comparison error"" should remain set to the ""TROUBLESHOOTING"" operating mode. The H CPU offers a function for detecting a memory error, fixing simple memory errors, and automatically returning to the ""RUN redundant"" system mode.

# Update of the reserve

The reserve CPU is updated each time an H system goes from the ""RUN solo mode"" to ""RUN redundant"" system mode. This process is often referred to as ""link-up and update"". In the link-up phase, the CPU in RUN copies all blocks to the stopped CPU. In the update phase, the data block values that have changed since copying are updated.

# 6.2 Special settings for H systems

The following images shows the default settings on the ""H Parameters"" tab:

# Parameters for the advanced CPU test

""Reaction to RAM/PAA comparison error"" should remain set to the ""TROUBLESHOOTING"" operating mode. The H CPU offers a function for detecting a memory error, fixing simple memory errors, and automatically returning to the ""RUN redundant"" system mode.

# Update of the reserve

The reserve CPU is updated each time an H system goes from the ""RUN solo mode"" to ""RUN redundant"" system mode. This process is often referred to as ""link-up and update"". In the link-up phase, the CPU in RUN copies all blocks to the stopped CPU. In the update phase, the data block values that have changed since copying are updated.

""Reaction to RAM/PAA comparison error"" should remain set to the ""TROUBLESHOOTING"" operating mode. The H CPU offers a function for detecting a memory error, fixing simple memory errors, and automatically returning to the ""RUN redundant"" system mode.

The reserve CPU is updated each time an H system goes from the ""RUN solo mode"" to ""RUN redundant"" system mode. This process is often referred to as ""link-up and update"". In the link-up phase, the CPU in RUN copies all blocks to the stopped CPU. In the update phase, the data block values that have changed since copying are updated.

# Update of the reserve

The reserve CPU is updated each time an H system goes from the ""RUN solo mode"" to ""RUN redundant"" system mode. This process is often referred to as ""link-up and update"". In the link-up phase, the CPU in RUN copies all blocks to the stopped CPU. In the update phase, the data block values that have changed since copying are updated.

You can find detailed information about link-up and update in the following manuals:

- It can cause the plant operator to stop acknowledging messages, even those which are not ""fluttering messages"". If this is the case, the operator will not realize that the event causing the message is recurring.
- The ATR property is a property of the CPU, which must be explicitly set for each CPU. If this property is not set to the same value for all CPUs, this can result in varying message behavior for the operator.
