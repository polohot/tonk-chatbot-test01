- Single message without acknowledgment
- Single message with came in acknowledgment
- Single message with dual-mode acknowledgment
- First value message with single-mode acknowledgment

- Filtering alarms via their properties
- Disabling messages

# Acknowledgment theory options

You can select from eight different states for the acknowledgment of a message:

- Single message without acknowledgment
- Single message with came in acknowledgment
- Single message with dual-mode acknowledgment
- First value message with single-mode acknowledgment
- New value message with single-mode acknowledgment
- New value message with dual-mode acknowledgment
- Message without ""went out"" status with acknowledgment
- Message without ""went out"" status without acknowledgment

|Option|Description|
|---|---|
|""Came in"" acknowledgment|Select the check box for a single message with incoming acknowledgment. Came in messages of this message class must be acknowledged. The message remains queued until it is acknowledged.|
|""Went out"" acknowledgment|Select the check box for a single message with dual acknowledgment. Went out messages of this message class must be acknowledgment.|
|Flashing on|Select the check box for a new value message with single or dual acknowledgment. The messages of this message class flash when displayed in the message window. For a message block to flash in Runtime, flashing must be activated in the properties of the respective message block.|
|Only for initial value|Select the check box for an initial value message with single acknowledgment. Only the first message of this message class flashes when displayed in the message window. The ""Flash On"" check box must be selected.|
|Without status ""went out""|Select the check box for a message without ""Went Out"" status with or without acknowledgment. When this option is activated, the messages do not have ""Outgoing"" status. If the message only recognizes the ""Came In"" status, the message is not entered in the message window and it is only archived.|
|Unique user|If you select the check box, the comments in the message window are assigned to the logged on user. The user must be registered in the ""User name"" system block. If no comment is entered, any user can enter the first comment. When the first comment is set, all other users have read-only access to this comment.|
|Comment|If you select the check box, the comment of the ""came in"" message is always displayed in user text blocks with the dynamic sections ""@100%@"", ""@101%@"", ""@102%@"","" and ""@103%@"". The display then depends on the status of the message in the message list.|
