The ""H Parameters"" tab is only available when a redundant system is used.

Note

These H-parameters for PROFIBUS are included in the calculation when calculating the monitoring times for updating. The following applies: As the number of DP slaves configured on the bus increases, the settings of these two H-parameters increase and the monitoring times for updating increase within the CPU parameters.

Settings in the ""Operating Mode"" tab

Set the DP mode to ""DPV1"" in the “Operating Mode” tab of the CP443-5 properties dialog:

""DPV1"" operating mode contains expansions for process automation, comprising acyclic data exchange in respect of the parameter assignment, operation, visualization, and interrupt control of intelligent programmable controllers, in parallel with cyclic data transmission.

In addition, DPV1 has three other interrupt types:

- Status interrupt
- Update interrupt
- Manufacturer-specific interrupt

Note

The DPV1 setting lets you connect and operate DP slaves that do not support DPV1.

Use the following default settings in the ""Options"" tab:

- Forward time frames: ""From station to LAN""
- Assign parameters of field devices (Data record routing): ""Activate data record gateway""

Note

The ""Data record gateway"" option must be activated in order to use data routing with PDM.

# 6.5 Settings of the internal PROFINET IO interface

# Introduction

The CPU 410 has two internal PN/Ethernet interfaces and thus enables the configuration of
two physically separated PROFINET segments. Up to 250 devices can be operated on each
PROFINET interface. Use of the CP 443-1 for PROFINET is not possible with the CPU 410.
