What situations will prevent online downloads of changes?

It is no longer possible to download changes if the following conditions are present:

- A used block type has been replaced by a new version that contains structural changes, for example, due to the addition of I/Os and/or messages. An exception to this is the CPU 410-5H process automation with a firmware version from V8.1 which supports the function ""Type Change in Run"" (TCiR). For more information, refer to the section ""Updating block types (Page 174)"".
- DB and FC number areas have been compressed during compilation using the menu command Options > Settings > Compile/Download… > Option: ""Compress"". DBs and FCs will be assigned a new numbering sequence in this case.
- When a modified program was downloaded to a different CPU prior to the download of changes, for example, for debugging purposes. In this case, the time stamp no longer matches the time stamp of the original CPU. An exception to this is provided where the ""Download to Test CPU"" option is used in the ""Download S7"" dialog box. In this case the download ID and the comparison time stamp are retained. You can still therefore transfer the program to the original CPU by downloading changes.
- If you resort to an archived program that is not the original from the most recent download (time stamp comparison).

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

If the parameters for a controller are changed in OS runtime, for example, they are written directly to the AS. If a complete download is made from the ES, the parameters changed on the OS will be overwritten by the ES. A prompt appears therefore before a complete download asking if you want to read back the parameters from the AS to the ES.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the ""Operational and observable parameters"" option. If the ""All parameters"" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

If read back of the parameters is confirmed with ""OK"", then the updated S7 program is downloaded in full to the AS following the read back.

Work can continue with compiling and downloading changes as soon as the AS is in RUN mode again.

Comparing Time Stamps

To check whether the AS has downloaded with the current configuration status you can run the ""Compare time stamp"" function in the CFC Editor via ""PLC > Compare"". The program currently configured has been downloaded if the time stamp of the last compilation is the same as the time stamp of the program downloaded and the time stamp of the last download-related change is dated before the two other time stamps. An easier check can be made directly via the symbol for the chart folder of the component view. If a small arrow is shown there in the symbol then the current configuration has not been downloaded.

Auto-archiving after successful download

Starting with PCS 7 version V8.1, the ""Auto-archiving"" function is available to you in the ""Download to target system"" dialog box. Archiving is performed automatically after downloading by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. The option can only be activated if a versioned project was selected via the ""Browse versioned project"" button. Archiving is performed automatically using a version trail by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. Archiving starts only after a successful download. Version Trail is opened for this purpose.

Note

The ""Archive project after successful download"" option requires that the Version trail options package is installed on the ES.

The ""Selective Download"" function can be used to download one or more modified CFCs or SFCs to a CPU. You can use selective downloading to specifically select which configured changes should be transferred to the target system and enabled. A parallel configuration of multiple subsystems onto one target system is possible in this regard, for example. In such a case, the changes can be compiled, downloaded, and tested for the individual subsystems.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

If the parameters for a controller are changed in OS runtime, for example, they are written directly to the AS. If a complete download is made from the ES, the parameters changed on the OS will be overwritten by the ES. A prompt appears therefore before a complete download asking if you want to read back the parameters from the AS to the ES.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the ""Operational and observable parameters"" option. If the ""All parameters"" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

If read back of the parameters is confirmed with ""OK"", then the updated S7 program is downloaded in full to the AS following the read back.

Work can continue with compiling and downloading changes as soon as the AS is in RUN mode again.

Comparing Time Stamps

To check whether the AS has downloaded with the current configuration status you can run the ""Compare time stamp"" function in the CFC Editor via ""PLC > Compare"". The program currently configured has been downloaded if the time stamp of the last compilation is the same as the time stamp of the program downloaded and the time stamp of the last download-related change is dated before the two other time stamps. An easier check can be made directly via the symbol for the chart folder of the component view. If a small arrow is shown there in the symbol then the current configuration has not been downloaded.

Auto-archiving after successful download

Starting with PCS 7 version V8.1, the ""Auto-archiving"" function is available to you in the ""Download to target system"" dialog box. Archiving is performed automatically after downloading by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. The option can only be activated if a versioned project was selected via the ""Browse versioned project"" button. Archiving is performed automatically using a version trail by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. Archiving starts only after a successful download. Version Trail is opened for this purpose.

Note

The ""Archive project after successful download"" option requires that the Version trail options package is installed on the ES.

# 9.3 Selective download

The ""Selective Download"" function can be used to download one or more modified CFCs or SFCs to a CPU. You can use selective downloading to specifically select which configured changes should be transferred to the target system and enabled. A parallel configuration of multiple subsystems onto one target system is possible in this regard, for example. In such a case, the changes can be compiled, downloaded, and tested for the individual subsystems.

# Selecting the charts

A dialog box displays all charts that can be selectively downloaded. Select the charts that you want to download in this dialog. Dependent charts are automatically selected from the system.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

# CAUTION

An exception to this is the CPU 410-5H process automation with a firmware version from V8.1 which supports the function ""Type Change in Run"" (TCiR). For more information, refer to the section ""Updating block types (Page 174)"".
- DB and FC number areas have been compressed during compilation using the menu command Options > Settings > Compile/Download… > Option: ""Compress"". DBs and FCs will be assigned a new numbering sequence in this case.
- When a modified program was downloaded to a different CPU prior to the download of changes, for example, for debugging purposes. In this case, the time stamp no longer matches the time stamp of the original CPU. An exception to this is provided where the ""Download to Test CPU"" option is used in the ""Download S7"" dialog box. In this case the download ID and the comparison time stamp are retained. You can still therefore transfer the program to the original CPU by downloading changes.
- If you resort to an archived program that is not the original from the most recent download (time stamp comparison).

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

# CAUTION

Make sure that no dangerous system states can arise before downloading.

What situations will prevent online downloads of changes?

It is no longer possible to download changes if the following conditions are present:

- A used block type has been replaced by a new version that contains structural changes, for example, due to the addition of I/Os and/or messages. An exception to this is the CPU 410-5H process automation with a firmware version from V8.1 which supports the function ""Type Change in Run"" (TCiR). For more information, refer to the section ""Updating block types (Page 174)"".
- DB and FC number areas have been compressed during compilation using the menu command Options > Settings > Compile/Download… > Option: ""Compress"". DBs and FCs will be assigned a new numbering sequence in this case.
- When a modified program was downloaded to a different CPU prior to the download of changes, for example, for debugging purposes. In this case, the time stamp no longer matches the time stamp of the original CPU. An exception to this is provided where the ""Download to Test CPU"" option is used in the ""Download S7"" dialog box. In this case the download ID and the comparison time stamp are retained. You can still therefore transfer the program to the original CPU by downloading changes.
- If you resort to an archived program that is not the original from the most recent download (time stamp comparison).

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

If the parameters for a controller are changed in OS runtime, for example, they are written directly to the AS. If a complete download is made from the ES, the parameters changed on the OS will be overwritten by the ES. A prompt appears therefore before a complete download asking if you want to read back the parameters from the AS to the ES.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the ""Operational and observable parameters"" option. If the ""All parameters"" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

If read back of the parameters is confirmed with ""OK"", then the updated S7 program is downloaded in full to the AS following the read back.

Work can continue with compiling and downloading changes as soon as the AS is in RUN mode again.

To check whether the AS has downloaded with the current configuration status you can run the ""Compare time stamp"" function in the CFC Editor via ""PLC > Compare"". The program currently configured has been downloaded if the time stamp of the last compilation is the same as the time stamp of the program downloaded and the time stamp of the last download-related change is dated before the two other time stamps. An easier check can be made directly via the symbol for the chart folder of the component view. If a small arrow is shown there in the symbol then the current configuration has not been downloaded.

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

If the parameters for a controller are changed in OS runtime, for example, they are written directly to the AS. If a complete download is made from the ES, the parameters changed on the OS will be overwritten by the ES. A prompt appears therefore before a complete download asking if you want to read back the parameters from the AS to the ES.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the ""Operational and observable parameters"" option. If the ""All parameters"" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

If read back of the parameters is confirmed with ""OK"", then the updated S7 program is downloaded in full to the AS following the read back.

Work can continue with compiling and downloading changes as soon as the AS is in RUN mode again.

Comparing Time Stamps

To check whether the AS has downloaded with the current configuration status you can run the ""Compare time stamp"" function in the CFC Editor via ""PLC > Compare"". The program currently configured has been downloaded if the time stamp of the last compilation is the same as the time stamp of the program downloaded and the time stamp of the last download-related change is dated before the two other time stamps. An easier check can be made directly via the symbol for the chart folder of the component view. If a small arrow is shown there in the symbol then the current configuration has not been downloaded.

Auto-archiving after successful download

Starting with PCS 7 version V8.1, the ""Auto-archiving"" function is available to you in the ""Download to target system"" dialog box. Archiving is performed automatically after downloading by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. The option can only be activated if a versioned project was selected via the ""Browse versioned project"" button. Archiving is performed automatically using a version trail by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. Archiving starts only after a successful download. Version Trail is opened for this purpose.

Note

The ""Archive project after successful download"" option requires that the Version trail options package is installed on the ES.

# 9.3 Selective download

The ""Selective Download"" function can be used to download one or more modified CFCs or SFCs to a CPU. You can use selective downloading to specifically select which configured changes should be transferred to the target system and enabled. A parallel configuration of multiple subsystems onto one target system is possible in this regard, for example. In such a case, the changes can be compiled, downloaded, and tested for the individual subsystems.

# Selecting the charts

A dialog box displays all charts that can be selectively downloaded. Select the charts that you want to download in this dialog. Dependent charts are automatically selected from the system.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

# 9.3 Selective download

The ""Selective Download"" function can be used to download one or more modified CFCs or SFCs to a CPU. You can use selective downloading to specifically select which configured changes should be transferred to the target system and enabled. A parallel configuration of multiple subsystems onto one target system is possible in this regard, for example. In such a case, the changes can be compiled, downloaded, and tested for the individual subsystems.

# Selecting the charts

A dialog box displays all charts that can be selectively downloaded. Select the charts that you want to download in this dialog. Dependent charts are automatically selected from the system.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

# CAUTION

Make sure that no dangerous system states can arise before downloading.

A full download is required when the user program is downloaded for the first time. For this the CPU switches from RUN to STOP mode following corresponding notification. Interface changes to a function or a function block also require a full download of the program.

Note

With PCS 7 V8.1 or higher and CPU 410-5H (firmware V8.1) an interface change of a function or a block does not necessarily mean you lose the ability to download changes (see section ""Updating block types (Page 174)""). Downloading the changes is then normally sufficient for any program expansions.

What situations will prevent online downloads of changes?

It is no longer possible to download changes if the following conditions are present:

- A used block type has been replaced by a new version that contains structural changes, for example, due to the addition of I/Os and/or messages. An exception to this is the CPU 410-5H process automation with a firmware version from V8.1 which supports the function ""Type Change in Run"" (TCiR). For more information, refer to the section ""Updating block types (Page 174)"".
- DB and FC number areas have been compressed during compilation using the menu command Options > Settings > Compile/Download… > Option: ""Compress"". DBs and FCs will be assigned a new numbering sequence in this case.
- When a modified program was downloaded to a different CPU prior to the download of changes, for example, for debugging purposes. In this case, the time stamp no longer matches the time stamp of the original CPU. An exception to this is provided where the ""Download to Test CPU"" option is used in the ""Download S7"" dialog box. In this case the download ID and the comparison time stamp are retained. You can still therefore transfer the program to the original CPU by downloading changes.
- If you resort to an archived program that is not the original from the most recent download (time stamp comparison).

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

If the parameters for a controller are changed in OS runtime, for example, they are written directly to the AS. If a complete download is made from the ES, the parameters changed on the OS will be overwritten by the ES. A prompt appears therefore before a complete download asking if you want to read back the parameters from the AS to the ES.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the ""Operational and observable parameters"" option. If the ""All parameters"" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

If read back of the parameters is confirmed with ""OK"", then the updated S7 program is downloaded in full to the AS following the read back.

Work can continue with compiling and downloading changes as soon as the AS is in RUN mode again.

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

If the parameters for a controller are changed in OS runtime, for example, they are written directly to the AS. If a complete download is made from the ES, the parameters changed on the OS will be overwritten by the ES. A prompt appears therefore before a complete download asking if you want to read back the parameters from the AS to the ES.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the ""Operational and observable parameters"" option. If the ""All parameters"" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

If read back of the parameters is confirmed with ""OK"", then the updated S7 program is downloaded in full to the AS following the read back.

Work can continue with compiling and downloading changes as soon as the AS is in RUN mode again.

Comparing Time Stamps

To check whether the AS has downloaded with the current configuration status you can run the ""Compare time stamp"" function in the CFC Editor via ""PLC > Compare"". The program currently configured has been downloaded if the time stamp of the last compilation is the same as the time stamp of the program downloaded and the time stamp of the last download-related change is dated before the two other time stamps. An easier check can be made directly via the symbol for the chart folder of the component view. If a small arrow is shown there in the symbol then the current configuration has not been downloaded.

Auto-archiving after successful download

Starting with PCS 7 version V8.1, the ""Auto-archiving"" function is available to you in the ""Download to target system"" dialog box. Archiving is performed automatically after downloading by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. The option can only be activated if a versioned project was selected via the ""Browse versioned project"" button. Archiving is performed automatically using a version trail by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. Archiving starts only after a successful download. Version Trail is opened for this purpose.

Note

The ""Archive project after successful download"" option requires that the Version trail options package is installed on the ES.

# 9.3 Selective download

The ""Selective Download"" function can be used to download one or more modified CFCs or SFCs to a CPU. You can use selective downloading to specifically select which configured changes should be transferred to the target system and enabled. A parallel configuration of multiple subsystems onto one target system is possible in this regard, for example. In such a case, the changes can be compiled, downloaded, and tested for the individual subsystems.

# Selecting the charts

A dialog box displays all charts that can be selectively downloaded. Select the charts that you want to download in this dialog. Dependent charts are automatically selected from the system.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

Archiving is performed automatically after downloading by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. The option can only be activated if a versioned project was selected via the ""Browse versioned project"" button. Archiving is performed automatically using a version trail by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. Archiving starts only after a successful download. Version Trail is opened for this purpose.

Note

The ""Archive project after successful download"" option requires that the Version trail options package is installed on the ES.

# 9.3 Selective download

The ""Selective Download"" function can be used to download one or more modified CFCs or SFCs to a CPU. You can use selective downloading to specifically select which configured changes should be transferred to the target system and enabled. A parallel configuration of multiple subsystems onto one target system is possible in this regard, for example. In such a case, the changes can be compiled, downloaded, and tested for the individual subsystems.

# Selecting the charts

A dialog box displays all charts that can be selectively downloaded. Select the charts that you want to download in this dialog. Dependent charts are automatically selected from the system.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

What situations will prevent online downloads of changes?

It is no longer possible to download changes if the following conditions are present:

- A used block type has been replaced by a new version that contains structural changes, for example, due to the addition of I/Os and/or messages. An exception to this is the CPU 410-5H process automation with a firmware version from V8.1 which supports the function ""Type Change in Run"" (TCiR). For more information, refer to the section ""Updating block types (Page 174)"".
- DB and FC number areas have been compressed during compilation using the menu command Options > Settings > Compile/Download… > Option: ""Compress"". DBs and FCs will be assigned a new numbering sequence in this case.
- When a modified program was downloaded to a different CPU prior to the download of changes, for example, for debugging purposes. In this case, the time stamp no longer matches the time stamp of the original CPU. An exception to this is provided where the ""Download to Test CPU"" option is used in the ""Download S7"" dialog box. In this case the download ID and the comparison time stamp are retained. You can still therefore transfer the program to the original CPU by downloading changes.
- If you resort to an archived program that is not the original from the most recent download (time stamp comparison).

If the parameters for a controller are changed in OS runtime, for example, they are written directly to the AS. If a complete download is made from the ES, the parameters changed on the OS will be overwritten by the ES. A prompt appears therefore before a complete download asking if you want to read back the parameters from the AS to the ES.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the ""Operational and observable parameters"" option. If the ""All parameters"" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

With PCS 7 V8.1 or higher and CPU 410-5H (firmware V8.1) an interface change of a function or a block does not necessarily mean you lose the ability to download changes (see section ""Updating block types (Page 174)""). Downloading the changes is then normally sufficient for any program expansions.

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

What situations will prevent online downloads of changes?

It is no longer possible to download changes if the following conditions are present:

- A used block type has been replaced by a new version that contains structural changes, for example, due to the addition of I/Os and/or messages. An exception to this is the CPU 410-5H process automation with a firmware version from V8.1 which supports the function ""Type Change in Run"" (TCiR). For more information, refer to the section ""Updating block types (Page 174)"".
- DB and FC number areas have been compressed during compilation using the menu command Options > Settings > Compile/Download… > Option: ""Compress"". DBs and FCs will be assigned a new numbering sequence in this case.
- When a modified program was downloaded to a different CPU prior to the download of changes, for example, for debugging purposes. In this case, the time stamp no longer matches the time stamp of the original CPU. An exception to this is provided where the ""Download to Test CPU"" option is used in the ""Download S7"" dialog box. In this case the download ID and the comparison time stamp are retained. You can still therefore transfer the program to the original CPU by downloading changes.
- If you resort to an archived program that is not the original from the most recent download (time stamp comparison).

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

If the parameters for a controller are changed in OS runtime, for example, they are written directly to the AS. If a complete download is made from the ES, the parameters changed on the OS will be overwritten by the ES. A prompt appears therefore before a complete download asking if you want to read back the parameters from the AS to the ES.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the ""Operational and observable parameters"" option. If the ""All parameters"" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

If read back of the parameters is confirmed with ""OK"", then the updated S7 program is downloaded in full to the AS following the read back.

Work can continue with compiling and downloading changes as soon as the AS is in RUN mode again.

Comparing Time Stamps

To check whether the AS has downloaded with the current configuration status you can run the ""Compare time stamp"" function in the CFC Editor via ""PLC > Compare"". The program currently configured has been downloaded if the time stamp of the last compilation is the same as the time stamp of the program downloaded and the time stamp of the last download-related change is dated before the two other time stamps. An easier check can be made directly via the symbol for the chart folder of the component view. If a small arrow is shown there in the symbol then the current configuration has not been downloaded.

Auto-archiving after successful download

Starting with PCS 7 version V8.1, the ""Auto-archiving"" function is available to you in the ""Download to target system"" dialog box. Archiving is performed automatically after downloading by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. The option can only be activated if a versioned project was selected via the ""Browse versioned project"" button. Archiving is performed automatically using a version trail by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. Archiving starts only after a successful download. Version Trail is opened for this purpose.

Note

The ""Archive project after successful download"" option requires that the Version trail options package is installed on the ES.

A parallel configuration of multiple subsystems onto one target system is possible in this regard, for example. In such a case, the changes can be compiled, downloaded, and tested for the individual subsystems.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the ""Operational and observable parameters"" option. If the ""All parameters"" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

If read back of the parameters is confirmed with ""OK"", then the updated S7 program is downloaded in full to the AS following the read back.

Work can continue with compiling and downloading changes as soon as the AS is in RUN mode again.

Comparing Time Stamps

To check whether the AS has downloaded with the current configuration status you can run the ""Compare time stamp"" function in the CFC Editor via ""PLC > Compare"". The program currently configured has been downloaded if the time stamp of the last compilation is the same as the time stamp of the program downloaded and the time stamp of the last download-related change is dated before the two other time stamps. An easier check can be made directly via the symbol for the chart folder of the component view. If a small arrow is shown there in the symbol then the current configuration has not been downloaded.

Auto-archiving after successful download

Starting with PCS 7 version V8.1, the ""Auto-archiving"" function is available to you in the ""Download to target system"" dialog box. Archiving is performed automatically after downloading by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. The option can only be activated if a versioned project was selected via the ""Browse versioned project"" button. Archiving is performed automatically using a version trail by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. Archiving starts only after a successful download. Version Trail is opened for this purpose.

Note

The ""Archive project after successful download"" option requires that the Version trail options package is installed on the ES.

# 9.3 Selective download

The ""Selective Download"" function can be used to download one or more modified CFCs or SFCs to a CPU. You can use selective downloading to specifically select which configured changes should be transferred to the target system and enabled. A parallel configuration of multiple subsystems onto one target system is possible in this regard, for example. In such a case, the changes can be compiled, downloaded, and tested for the individual subsystems.

# Selecting the charts

A dialog box displays all charts that can be selectively downloaded. Select the charts that you want to download in this dialog. Dependent charts are automatically selected from the system.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

# CAUTION

Make sure that no dangerous system states can arise before downloading.

It is no longer possible to download changes if the following conditions are present:

- A used block type has been replaced by a new version that contains structural changes, for example, due to the addition of I/Os and/or messages. An exception to this is the CPU 410-5H process automation with a firmware version from V8.1 which supports the function ""Type Change in Run"" (TCiR). For more information, refer to the section ""Updating block types (Page 174)"".
- DB and FC number areas have been compressed during compilation using the menu command Options > Settings > Compile/Download… > Option: ""Compress"". DBs and FCs will be assigned a new numbering sequence in this case.
- When a modified program was downloaded to a different CPU prior to the download of changes, for example, for debugging purposes. In this case, the time stamp no longer matches the time stamp of the original CPU. An exception to this is provided where the ""Download to Test CPU"" option is used in the ""Download S7"" dialog box. In this case the download ID and the comparison time stamp are retained. You can still therefore transfer the program to the original CPU by downloading changes.
- If you resort to an archived program that is not the original from the most recent download (time stamp comparison).

What situations will prevent online downloads of changes?

It is no longer possible to download changes if the following conditions are present:

- A used block type has been replaced by a new version that contains structural changes, for example, due to the addition of I/Os and/or messages. An exception to this is the CPU 410-5H process automation with a firmware version from V8.1 which supports the function ""Type Change in Run"" (TCiR). For more information, refer to the section ""Updating block types (Page 174)"".
- DB and FC number areas have been compressed during compilation using the menu command Options > Settings > Compile/Download… > Option: ""Compress"". DBs and FCs will be assigned a new numbering sequence in this case.
- When a modified program was downloaded to a different CPU prior to the download of changes, for example, for debugging purposes. In this case, the time stamp no longer matches the time stamp of the original CPU. An exception to this is provided where the ""Download to Test CPU"" option is used in the ""Download S7"" dialog box. In this case the download ID and the comparison time stamp are retained. You can still therefore transfer the program to the original CPU by downloading changes.
- If you resort to an archived program that is not the original from the most recent download (time stamp comparison).

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

If the parameters for a controller are changed in OS runtime, for example, they are written directly to the AS. If a complete download is made from the ES, the parameters changed on the OS will be overwritten by the ES. A prompt appears therefore before a complete download asking if you want to read back the parameters from the AS to the ES.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the ""Operational and observable parameters"" option. If the ""All parameters"" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

If read back of the parameters is confirmed with ""OK"", then the updated S7 program is downloaded in full to the AS following the read back.

Work can continue with compiling and downloading changes as soon as the AS is in RUN mode again.

Comparing Time Stamps

To check whether the AS has downloaded with the current configuration status you can run the ""Compare time stamp"" function in the CFC Editor via ""PLC > Compare"". The program currently configured has been downloaded if the time stamp of the last compilation is the same as the time stamp of the program downloaded and the time stamp of the last download-related change is dated before the two other time stamps. An easier check can be made directly via the symbol for the chart folder of the component view. If a small arrow is shown there in the symbol then the current configuration has not been downloaded.

Auto-archiving after successful download

Starting with PCS 7 version V8.1, the ""Auto-archiving"" function is available to you in the ""Download to target system"" dialog box. Archiving is performed automatically after downloading by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. The option can only be activated if a versioned project was selected via the ""Browse versioned project"" button. Archiving is performed automatically using a version trail by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. Archiving starts only after a successful download. Version Trail is opened for this purpose.

Note

The ""Archive project after successful download"" option requires that the Version trail options package is installed on the ES.

The ""Selective Download"" function can be used to download one or more modified CFCs or SFCs to a CPU. You can use selective downloading to specifically select which configured changes should be transferred to the target system and enabled. A parallel configuration of multiple subsystems onto one target system is possible in this regard, for example. In such a case, the changes can be compiled, downloaded, and tested for the individual subsystems.

# Selecting the charts

A dialog box displays all charts that can be selectively downloaded. Select the charts that you want to download in this dialog. Dependent charts are automatically selected from the system.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

If the parameters for a controller are changed in OS runtime, for example, they are written directly to the AS. If a complete download is made from the ES, the parameters changed on the OS will be overwritten by the ES. A prompt appears therefore before a complete download asking if you want to read back the parameters from the AS to the ES.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the ""Operational and observable parameters"" option. If the ""All parameters"" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

If read back of the parameters is confirmed with ""OK"", then the updated S7 program is downloaded in full to the AS following the read back.

Work can continue with compiling and downloading changes as soon as the AS is in RUN mode again.

Comparing Time Stamps

To check whether the AS has downloaded with the current configuration status you can run the ""Compare time stamp"" function in the CFC Editor via ""PLC > Compare"". The program currently configured has been downloaded if the time stamp of the last compilation is the same as the time stamp of the program downloaded and the time stamp of the last download-related change is dated before the two other time stamps. An easier check can be made directly via the symbol for the chart folder of the component view. If a small arrow is shown there in the symbol then the current configuration has not been downloaded.

Auto-archiving after successful download

Starting with PCS 7 version V8.1, the ""Auto-archiving"" function is available to you in the ""Download to target system"" dialog box. Archiving is performed automatically after downloading by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. The option can only be activated if a versioned project was selected via the ""Browse versioned project"" button. Archiving is performed automatically using a version trail by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. Archiving starts only after a successful download. Version Trail is opened for this purpose.

Note

The ""Archive project after successful download"" option requires that the Version trail options package is installed on the ES.

# 9.3 Selective download

The ""Selective Download"" function can be used to download one or more modified CFCs or SFCs to a CPU. You can use selective downloading to specifically select which configured changes should be transferred to the target system and enabled. A parallel configuration of multiple subsystems onto one target system is possible in this regard, for example. In such a case, the changes can be compiled, downloaded, and tested for the individual subsystems.

# Selecting the charts

A dialog box displays all charts that can be selectively downloaded. Select the charts that you want to download in this dialog. Dependent charts are automatically selected from the system.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

# CAUTION

Make sure that no dangerous system states can arise before downloading.

What situations will prevent online downloads of changes?

It is no longer possible to download changes if the following conditions are present:

- A used block type has been replaced by a new version that contains structural changes, for example, due to the addition of I/Os and/or messages. An exception to this is the CPU 410-5H process automation with a firmware version from V8.1 which supports the function ""Type Change in Run"" (TCiR). For more information, refer to the section ""Updating block types (Page 174)"".
- DB and FC number areas have been compressed during compilation using the menu command Options > Settings > Compile/Download… > Option: ""Compress"". DBs and FCs will be assigned a new numbering sequence in this case.
- When a modified program was downloaded to a different CPU prior to the download of changes, for example, for debugging purposes. In this case, the time stamp no longer matches the time stamp of the original CPU. An exception to this is provided where the ""Download to Test CPU"" option is used in the ""Download S7"" dialog box. In this case the download ID and the comparison time stamp are retained. You can still therefore transfer the program to the original CPU by downloading changes.
- If you resort to an archived program that is not the original from the most recent download (time stamp comparison).

A dialog box displays all charts that can be selectively downloaded. Select the charts that you want to download in this dialog. Dependent charts are automatically selected from the system.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

A full download is required when the user program is downloaded for the first time. For this the CPU switches from RUN to STOP mode following corresponding notification. Interface changes to a function or a function block also require a full download of the program.

Note

With PCS 7 V8.1 or higher and CPU 410-5H (firmware V8.1) an interface change of a function or a block does not necessarily mean you lose the ability to download changes (see section ""Updating block types (Page 174)""). Downloading the changes is then normally sufficient for any program expansions.

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

What situations will prevent online downloads of changes?

It is no longer possible to download changes if the following conditions are present:

- A used block type has been replaced by a new version that contains structural changes, for example, due to the addition of I/Os and/or messages. An exception to this is the CPU 410-5H process automation with a firmware version from V8.1 which supports the function ""Type Change in Run"" (TCiR). For more information, refer to the section ""Updating block types (Page 174)"".
- DB and FC number areas have been compressed during compilation using the menu command Options > Settings > Compile/Download… > Option: ""Compress"". DBs and FCs will be assigned a new numbering sequence in this case.
- When a modified program was downloaded to a different CPU prior to the download of changes, for example, for debugging purposes. In this case, the time stamp no longer matches the time stamp of the original CPU. An exception to this is provided where the ""Download to Test CPU"" option is used in the ""Download S7"" dialog box. In this case the download ID and the comparison time stamp are retained. You can still therefore transfer the program to the original CPU by downloading changes.
- If you resort to an archived program that is not the original from the most recent download (time stamp comparison).

Note

Refer to the online help for the CFC Editor and to the ""Downloading changes online (Page 305)"" section for additional information.

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

If the parameters for a controller are changed in OS runtime, for example, they are written directly to the AS. If a complete download is made from the ES, the parameters changed on the OS will be overwritten by the ES. A prompt appears therefore before a complete download asking if you want to read back the parameters from the AS to the ES.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the ""Operational and observable parameters"" option. If the ""All parameters"" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

If read back of the parameters is confirmed with ""OK"", then the updated S7 program is downloaded in full to the AS following the read back.

Work can continue with compiling and downloading changes as soon as the AS is in RUN mode again.

Comparing Time Stamps

To check whether the AS has downloaded with the current configuration status you can run the ""Compare time stamp"" function in the CFC Editor via ""PLC > Compare"". The program currently configured has been downloaded if the time stamp of the last compilation is the same as the time stamp of the program downloaded and the time stamp of the last download-related change is dated before the two other time stamps. An easier check can be made directly via the symbol for the chart folder of the component view. If a small arrow is shown there in the symbol then the current configuration has not been downloaded.

Auto-archiving after successful download

Starting with PCS 7 version V8.1, the ""Auto-archiving"" function is available to you in the ""Download to target system"" dialog box. Archiving is performed automatically after downloading by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. The option can only be activated if a versioned project was selected via the ""Browse versioned project"" button. Archiving is performed automatically using a version trail by activating the ""Archive project after successful download"" option. Archiving starts only after a successful download. Version Trail is opened for this purpose.

Note

The ""Archive project after successful download"" option requires that the Version trail options package is installed on the ES.

# 9.3 Selective download

The ""Selective Download"" function can be used to download one or more modified CFCs or SFCs to a CPU. You can use selective downloading to specifically select which configured changes should be transferred to the target system and enabled. A parallel configuration of multiple subsystems onto one target system is possible in this regard, for example. In such a case, the changes can be compiled, downloaded, and tested for the individual subsystems.

# Selecting the charts

A dialog box displays all charts that can be selectively downloaded. Select the charts that you want to download in this dialog. Dependent charts are automatically selected from the system.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix ""@"" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.
