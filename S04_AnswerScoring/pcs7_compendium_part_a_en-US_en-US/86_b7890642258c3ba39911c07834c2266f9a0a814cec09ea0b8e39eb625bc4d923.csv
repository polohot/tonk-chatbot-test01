Chart-based insertion of blocks in runtime groups in OB 100

To use the ""Selective Download"" function, it is recommended to enable the ""Chart-based insertion"" option in the ""Properties Chart Folder"" dialog.

With the ""chart-based insertion"" option activated, an appropriate runtime group is automatically created in the OB 100 when instantiating blocks with startup characteristics. All block instances in a chart that have a startup characteristic are integrated in the cyclical runtime groups and in the runtime group assigned to this plan in the OB 100.

- With PCS 7 projects created from version V8.1 onwards, the ""chart-based insertion"" option is activated automatically in the properties of the chart folder.
- The ""chart-based insertion"" option must be activated manually for upgraded projects created with a version before V8.1. After the activation, the option only affects newly created charts. The existing charts and their configuration are not affected by this activation.

To activate this function select the relevant chart folder and select the context menu ""Object Properties > Expanded"".

Inserting the new blocks of a chart in the runtime group of this chart reduces the number of dependent charts, which would also need to be included in the selective download.

# 9.4 Compile OS

# Introduction

With the OS compilation all the relevant AS engineering data is transferred to the OS project and any corresponding OSD objects are created automatically (e.g. picture hierarchy, SFC display, process tag symbols and picture blocks, tags, messages, archive tags, OS server package). The actual OS configuration is thereby reduced to creating the static picture objects and positioning the process tag symbols created.

# OS compilation mode

The OS compilation mode can compile multiple OS within a project with an OS single/OS server station via the ""Options > Compile multiple OS assistant"" menu in the SIMATIC Manager (""20_OS"" in the example).

With the ""Area-oriented"" mode the OS allocation of the area determined in the plant hierarchy (PH) is decisive rather than the S7 program allocated when creating the OS objects during the OS compilation. You can only select this mode when there is a configured PH. This mode is the default for new projects as of V6.1.

Note

We recommend using the ""Area-oriented"" compilation mode. This setting must be used for the PCS 7 Web option and PCS 7 asset management functions.

A change between area-based and AS-based requires that one AS is only assigned to one OS. Otherwise, messages are displayed more than once. To save time during compilation, areas to which no amendments were made can be selected. Therefore, only the amended AS is compiled.

Following each change, a complete compilation with memory reset is forced.

The OS compilation mode can compile multiple OS within a project with an OS single/OS server station via the ""Options > Compile multiple OS assistant"" menu in the SIMATIC Manager (""20_OS"" in the example).

With the ""Area-oriented"" mode the OS allocation of the area determined in the plant hierarchy (PH) is decisive rather than the S7 program allocated when creating the OS objects during the OS compilation. You can only select this mode when there is a configured PH. This mode is the default for new projects as of V6.1.

Note

We recommend using the ""Area-oriented"" compilation mode. This setting must be used for the PCS 7 Web option and PCS 7 asset management functions.

A change between area-based and AS-based requires that one AS is only assigned to one OS. Otherwise, messages are displayed more than once. To save time during compilation, areas to which no amendments were made can be selected. Therefore, only the amended AS is compiled.

From PCS 7 V8.2, the function ""Migration to chart-based insertion"" is available. This function allows you to automatically change existing CFC charts, whose blocks are not contained in chart-based runtime groups in the OB 100, to chart-based administration. I.e., the blocks of a CFC chart are automatically inserted in new, chart-related runtime groups. The chart-related runtime groups receive the same names as the corresponding CFC charts and a serial number, if required.

You can find further information in FAQ ""How do you use the ""Selective Download"" function in migrated PCS 7 projects?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109478772).

Color representation of a block or chart I/O

If a block or chart I/O has been changed, for example, due to configuration or interconnection, this status is indicated by a colored representation of this I/O. The color representation can be changed through the system function ""Extras -> Settings -> Colors"".

# 9.4 Compile OS

# Introduction

With the OS compilation all the relevant AS engineering data is transferred to the OS project and any corresponding OSD objects are created automatically (e.g. picture hierarchy, SFC display, process tag symbols and picture blocks, tags, messages, archive tags, OS server package). The actual OS configuration is thereby reduced to creating the static picture objects and positioning the process tag symbols created.

# OS compilation mode

The OS compilation mode can compile multiple OS within a project with an OS single/OS server station via the ""Options > Compile multiple OS assistant"" menu in the SIMATIC Manager (""20_OS"" in the example).

With the ""Area-oriented"" mode the OS allocation of the area determined in the plant hierarchy (PH) is decisive rather than the S7 program allocated when creating the OS objects during the OS compilation. You can only select this mode when there is a configured PH. This mode is the default for new projects as of V6.1.

Note

We recommend using the ""Area-oriented"" compilation mode. This setting must be used for the PCS 7 Web option and PCS 7 asset management functions.

A change between area-based and AS-based requires that one AS is only assigned to one OS. Otherwise, messages are displayed more than once. To save time during compilation, areas to which no amendments were made can be selected. Therefore, only the amended AS is compiled.

Following each change, a complete compilation with memory reset is forced.

Chart-based insertion of blocks in runtime groups in OB 100

To use the ""Selective Download"" function, it is recommended to enable the ""Chart-based insertion"" option in the ""Properties Chart Folder"" dialog.

With the ""chart-based insertion"" option activated, an appropriate runtime group is automatically created in the OB 100 when instantiating blocks with startup characteristics. All block instances in a chart that have a startup characteristic are integrated in the cyclical runtime groups and in the runtime group assigned to this plan in the OB 100.

- With PCS 7 projects created from version V8.1 onwards, the ""chart-based insertion"" option is activated automatically in the properties of the chart folder.
- The ""chart-based insertion"" option must be activated manually for upgraded projects created with a version before V8.1. After the activation, the option only affects newly created charts. The existing charts and their configuration are not affected by this activation.

To activate this function select the relevant chart folder and select the context menu ""Object Properties > Expanded"".

Inserting the new blocks of a chart in the runtime group of this chart reduces the number of dependent charts, which would also need to be included in the selective download.

Chart-based insertion of blocks in runtime groups in OB 100

To use the ""Selective Download"" function, it is recommended to enable the ""Chart-based insertion"" option in the ""Properties Chart Folder"" dialog.

With the ""chart-based insertion"" option activated, an appropriate runtime group is automatically created in the OB 100 when instantiating blocks with startup characteristics. All block instances in a chart that have a startup characteristic are integrated in the cyclical runtime groups and in the runtime group assigned to this plan in the OB 100.

- With PCS 7 projects created from version V8.1 onwards, the ""chart-based insertion"" option is activated automatically in the properties of the chart folder.
- The ""chart-based insertion"" option must be activated manually for upgraded projects created with a version before V8.1. After the activation, the option only affects newly created charts. The existing charts and their configuration are not affected by this activation.

To activate this function select the relevant chart folder and select the context menu ""Object Properties > Expanded"".

Inserting the new blocks of a chart in the runtime group of this chart reduces the number of dependent charts, which would also need to be included in the selective download.

# 9.4 Compile OS

# Introduction

With the OS compilation all the relevant AS engineering data is transferred to the OS project and any corresponding OSD objects are created automatically (e.g. picture hierarchy, SFC display, process tag symbols and picture blocks, tags, messages, archive tags, OS server package). The actual OS configuration is thereby reduced to creating the static picture objects and positioning the process tag symbols created.

# OS compilation mode

The OS compilation mode can compile multiple OS within a project with an OS single/OS server station via the ""Options > Compile multiple OS assistant"" menu in the SIMATIC Manager (""20_OS"" in the example).

With the ""Area-oriented"" mode the OS allocation of the area determined in the plant hierarchy (PH) is decisive rather than the S7 program allocated when creating the OS objects during the OS compilation. You can only select this mode when there is a configured PH. This mode is the default for new projects as of V6.1.

Note

We recommend using the ""Area-oriented"" compilation mode. This setting must be used for the PCS 7 Web option and PCS 7 asset management functions.

A change between area-based and AS-based requires that one AS is only assigned to one OS. Otherwise, messages are displayed more than once. To save time during compilation, areas to which no amendments were made can be selected. Therefore, only the amended AS is compiled.

Following each change, a complete compilation with memory reset is forced.

Chart-based insertion of blocks in runtime groups in OB 100

To use the ""Selective Download"" function, it is recommended to enable the ""Chart-based insertion"" option in the ""Properties Chart Folder"" dialog.

With the ""chart-based insertion"" option activated, an appropriate runtime group is automatically created in the OB 100 when instantiating blocks with startup characteristics. All block instances in a chart that have a startup characteristic are integrated in the cyclical runtime groups and in the runtime group assigned to this plan in the OB 100.

- With PCS 7 projects created from version V8.1 onwards, the ""chart-based insertion"" option is activated automatically in the properties of the chart folder.
- The ""chart-based insertion"" option must be activated manually for upgraded projects created with a version before V8.1. After the activation, the option only affects newly created charts. The existing charts and their configuration are not affected by this activation.

To activate this function select the relevant chart folder and select the context menu ""Object Properties > Expanded"".

Inserting the new blocks of a chart in the runtime group of this chart reduces the number of dependent charts, which would also need to be included in the selective download.

# 9.4 Compile OS

# Introduction

With the OS compilation all the relevant AS engineering data is transferred to the OS project and any corresponding OSD objects are created automatically (e.g. picture hierarchy, SFC display, process tag symbols and picture blocks, tags, messages, archive tags, OS server package). The actual OS configuration is thereby reduced to creating the static picture objects and positioning the process tag symbols created.

# OS compilation mode

The OS compilation mode can compile multiple OS within a project with an OS single/OS server station via the ""Options > Compile multiple OS assistant"" menu in the SIMATIC Manager (""20_OS"" in the example).

With the ""Area-oriented"" mode the OS allocation of the area determined in the plant hierarchy (PH) is decisive rather than the S7 program allocated when creating the OS objects during the OS compilation. You can only select this mode when there is a configured PH. This mode is the default for new projects as of V6.1.

Note

We recommend using the ""Area-oriented"" compilation mode. This setting must be used for the PCS 7 Web option and PCS 7 asset management functions.

# 9.4 Compile OS

# Introduction

With the OS compilation all the relevant AS engineering data is transferred to the OS project and any corresponding OSD objects are created automatically (e.g. picture hierarchy, SFC display, process tag symbols and picture blocks, tags, messages, archive tags, OS server package). The actual OS configuration is thereby reduced to creating the static picture objects and positioning the process tag symbols created.

# OS compilation mode

The OS compilation mode can compile multiple OS within a project with an OS single/OS server station via the ""Options > Compile multiple OS assistant"" menu in the SIMATIC Manager (""20_OS"" in the example).

With the ""Area-oriented"" mode the OS allocation of the area determined in the plant hierarchy (PH) is decisive rather than the S7 program allocated when creating the OS objects during the OS compilation. You can only select this mode when there is a configured PH. This mode is the default for new projects as of V6.1.

Note

We recommend using the ""Area-oriented"" compilation mode. This setting must be used for the PCS 7 Web option and PCS 7 asset management functions.

A change between area-based and AS-based requires that one AS is only assigned to one OS. Otherwise, messages are displayed more than once. To save time during compilation, areas to which no amendments were made can be selected. Therefore, only the amended AS is compiled.

Following each change, a complete compilation with memory reset is forced.

""Migration to chart-based insertion"" function

From PCS 7 V8.2, the function ""Migration to chart-based insertion"" is available. This function allows you to automatically change existing CFC charts, whose blocks are not contained in chart-based runtime groups in the OB 100, to chart-based administration. I.e., the blocks of a CFC chart are automatically inserted in new, chart-related runtime groups. The chart-related runtime groups receive the same names as the corresponding CFC charts and a serial number, if required.

# 9.4 Compile OS

# Introduction

With the OS compilation all the relevant AS engineering data is transferred to the OS project and any corresponding OSD objects are created automatically (e.g. picture hierarchy, SFC display, process tag symbols and picture blocks, tags, messages, archive tags, OS server package). The actual OS configuration is thereby reduced to creating the static picture objects and positioning the process tag symbols created.

# OS compilation mode

The OS compilation mode can compile multiple OS within a project with an OS single/OS server station via the ""Options > Compile multiple OS assistant"" menu in the SIMATIC Manager (""20_OS"" in the example).

With the ""Area-oriented"" mode the OS allocation of the area determined in the plant hierarchy (PH) is decisive rather than the S7 program allocated when creating the OS objects during the OS compilation. You can only select this mode when there is a configured PH. This mode is the default for new projects as of V6.1.

Note

We recommend using the ""Area-oriented"" compilation mode. This setting must be used for the PCS 7 Web option and PCS 7 asset management functions.

A change between area-based and AS-based requires that one AS is only assigned to one OS. Otherwise, messages are displayed more than once. To save time during compilation, areas to which no amendments were made can be selected. Therefore, only the amended AS is compiled.

Following each change, a complete compilation with memory reset is forced.

Chart-based insertion of blocks in runtime groups in OB 100

To use the ""Selective Download"" function, it is recommended to enable the ""Chart-based insertion"" option in the ""Properties Chart Folder"" dialog.

With the ""chart-based insertion"" option activated, an appropriate runtime group is automatically created in the OB 100 when instantiating blocks with startup characteristics. All block instances in a chart that have a startup characteristic are integrated in the cyclical runtime groups and in the runtime group assigned to this plan in the OB 100.

- With PCS 7 projects created from version V8.1 onwards, the ""chart-based insertion"" option is activated automatically in the properties of the chart folder.
- The ""chart-based insertion"" option must be activated manually for upgraded projects created with a version before V8.1. After the activation, the option only affects newly created charts. The existing charts and their configuration are not affected by this activation.

To activate this function select the relevant chart folder and select the context menu ""Object Properties > Expanded"".

Inserting the new blocks of a chart in the runtime group of this chart reduces the number of dependent charts, which would also need to be included in the selective download.

# 9.4 Compile OS

# Introduction

With the OS compilation all the relevant AS engineering data is transferred to the OS project and any corresponding OSD objects are created automatically (e.g. picture hierarchy, SFC display, process tag symbols and picture blocks, tags, messages, archive tags, OS server package). The actual OS configuration is thereby reduced to creating the static picture objects and positioning the process tag symbols created.

# OS compilation mode

The OS compilation mode can compile multiple OS within a project with an OS single/OS server station via the ""Options > Compile multiple OS assistant"" menu in the SIMATIC Manager (""20_OS"" in the example).

With the ""Area-oriented"" mode the OS allocation of the area determined in the plant hierarchy (PH) is decisive rather than the S7 program allocated when creating the OS objects during the OS compilation. You can only select this mode when there is a configured PH. This mode is the default for new projects as of V6.1.

Note

We recommend using the ""Area-oriented"" compilation mode. This setting must be used for the PCS 7 Web option and PCS 7 asset management functions.

A change between area-based and AS-based requires that one AS is only assigned to one OS. Otherwise, messages are displayed more than once. To save time during compilation, areas to which no amendments were made can be selected. Therefore, only the amended AS is compiled.

Following each change, a complete compilation with memory reset is forced.

With the OS compilation all the relevant AS engineering data is transferred to the OS project and any corresponding OSD objects are created automatically (e.g. picture hierarchy, SFC display, process tag symbols and picture blocks, tags, messages, archive tags, OS server package). The actual OS configuration is thereby reduced to creating the static picture objects and positioning the process tag symbols created.

# OS compilation mode

The OS compilation mode can compile multiple OS within a project with an OS single/OS server station via the ""Options > Compile multiple OS assistant"" menu in the SIMATIC Manager (""20_OS"" in the example).

With the ""Area-oriented"" mode the OS allocation of the area determined in the plant hierarchy (PH) is decisive rather than the S7 program allocated when creating the OS objects during the OS compilation. You can only select this mode when there is a configured PH. This mode is the default for new projects as of V6.1.

Note

We recommend using the ""Area-oriented"" compilation mode. This setting must be used for the PCS 7 Web option and PCS 7 asset management functions.

A change between area-based and AS-based requires that one AS is only assigned to one OS. Otherwise, messages are displayed more than once. To save time during compilation, areas to which no amendments were made can be selected. Therefore, only the amended AS is compiled.

Following each change, a complete compilation with memory reset is forced.

Chart-based insertion of blocks in runtime groups in OB 100

To use the ""Selective Download"" function, it is recommended to enable the ""Chart-based insertion"" option in the ""Properties Chart Folder"" dialog.

With the ""chart-based insertion"" option activated, an appropriate runtime group is automatically created in the OB 100 when instantiating blocks with startup characteristics. All block instances in a chart that have a startup characteristic are integrated in the cyclical runtime groups and in the runtime group assigned to this plan in the OB 100.

- With PCS 7 projects created from version V8.1 onwards, the ""chart-based insertion"" option is activated automatically in the properties of the chart folder.
- The ""chart-based insertion"" option must be activated manually for upgraded projects created with a version before V8.1. After the activation, the option only affects newly created charts. The existing charts and their configuration are not affected by this activation.

To activate this function select the relevant chart folder and select the context menu ""Object Properties > Expanded"".

Inserting the new blocks of a chart in the runtime group of this chart reduces the number of dependent charts, which would also need to be included in the selective download.

""Migration to chart-based insertion"" function

From PCS 7 V8.2, the function ""Migration to chart-based insertion"" is available. This function allows you to automatically change existing CFC charts, whose blocks are not contained in chart-based runtime groups in the OB 100, to chart-based administration. I.e., the blocks of a CFC chart are automatically inserted in new, chart-related runtime groups. The chart-related runtime groups receive the same names as the corresponding CFC charts and a serial number, if required.

Color representation of a block or chart I/O

If a block or chart I/O has been changed, for example, due to configuration or interconnection, this status is indicated by a colored representation of this I/O. The color representation can be changed through the system function ""Extras -> Settings -> Colors"".
