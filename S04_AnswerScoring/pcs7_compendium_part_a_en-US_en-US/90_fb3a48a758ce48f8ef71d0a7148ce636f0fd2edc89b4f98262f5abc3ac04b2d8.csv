# 9.4 Compile OS

Create/Update Block Icons

As of PCS 7 V7.0, the ""Create/Update Block Icons"" function is no longer listed as an option for OS compilation. If the ""Derive block icons from the plant hierarchy"" check box is set in the properties of a picture, the function is called automatically when the OS is compiled.
