- Enter the path for the target OS computer. A shared folder with write access must be available on the target OS.
- Enter a meaningful name for the symbolic computer name. The symbolic computer name determines the server prefix and therefore the server data. It is decisive for the OS server-client communication. Avoid any special country-specific characters with this. This setting can only be entered with the initial configuration.
- Select ""OS1_Stby"" from the selection menu in the ""Standby OS"" area.
- Select the ""Transfer to external archive server"" check box if necessary.
