One of the first and most important tasks in a project is defining the plant hierarchy (PH). The PH is the basis for the outward appearance of the OS runtime or for the integration of SIMATIC BATCH.

# 5.6 Creating the plant hierarchy

# Introduction

The individual stations have been added and the configuration of the automation system has been stored in the SIMATIC Manager component view. The plant view is used to portray the hierarchy of the process structure in the project.

One of the first and most important tasks in a project is defining the plant hierarchy (PH). The PH is the basis for the outward appearance of the OS runtime or for the integration of SIMATIC BATCH.

# Creating the PH

In the example project ""Comp_MP"" the PH of the AS projects is structured as shown below:

One of the first and most important tasks in a project is defining the plant hierarchy (PH). The PH is the basis for the outward appearance of the OS runtime or for the integration of SIMATIC BATCH.

# 5.6 Creating the plant hierarchy

# Introduction

The individual stations have been added and the configuration of the automation system has been stored in the SIMATIC Manager component view. The plant view is used to portray the hierarchy of the process structure in the project.

One of the first and most important tasks in a project is defining the plant hierarchy (PH). The PH is the basis for the outward appearance of the OS runtime or for the integration of SIMATIC BATCH.

# Creating the PH

In the example project ""Comp_MP"" the PH of the AS projects is structured as shown below:
