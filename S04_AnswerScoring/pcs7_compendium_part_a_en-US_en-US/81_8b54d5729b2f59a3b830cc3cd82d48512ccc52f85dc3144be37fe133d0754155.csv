# 8.3 Generation of logical operations

# General information on logical operations

Logical operations are used for interlocking functions, for example. These can be implemented within the PCS 7 program with the help of function blocks in the CFC. From PCS 7 V8.2, the SIMATIC Logic Matrix supports the generation of the required operations with an interface.

Generating logical operations with the Logic Matrix offers the following advantages:

- Clear generation of logical operations with the Logic Matrix Editor.
- Easy to amend and optimize the logical operations.
- Clear representation of the logical operations in the OS runtime.
- Filter options for quickly locating the cause of interlocking in the OS runtime.

Logical operations are used for interlocking functions, for example. These can be implemented within the PCS 7 program with the help of function blocks in the CFC. From PCS 7 V8.2, the SIMATIC Logic Matrix supports the generation of the required operations with an interface.

Generating logical operations with the Logic Matrix offers the following advantages:

- Clear generation of logical operations with the Logic Matrix Editor.
- Easy to amend and optimize the logical operations.
- Clear representation of the logical operations in the OS runtime.
- Filter options for quickly locating the cause of interlocking in the OS runtime.

Note

# 8.3 Generation of logical operations

# General information on logical operations

Logical operations are used for interlocking functions, for example. These can be implemented within the PCS 7 program with the help of function blocks in the CFC. From PCS 7 V8.2, the SIMATIC Logic Matrix supports the generation of the required operations with an interface.

Generating logical operations with the Logic Matrix offers the following advantages:

- Clear generation of logical operations with the Logic Matrix Editor.
- Easy to amend and optimize the logical operations.
- Clear representation of the logical operations in the OS runtime.
- Filter options for quickly locating the cause of interlocking in the OS runtime.

# 8.3 Generation of logical operations

# General information on logical operations

Logical operations are used for interlocking functions, for example. These can be implemented within the PCS 7 program with the help of function blocks in the CFC. From PCS 7 V8.2, the SIMATIC Logic Matrix supports the generation of the required operations with an interface.

Generating logical operations with the Logic Matrix offers the following advantages:

- Clear generation of logical operations with the Logic Matrix Editor.
- Easy to amend and optimize the logical operations.
- Clear representation of the logical operations in the OS runtime.
- Filter options for quickly locating the cause of interlocking in the OS runtime.

# 8.3 Generation of logical operations

# General information on logical operations

Logical operations are used for interlocking functions, for example. These can be implemented within the PCS 7 program with the help of function blocks in the CFC. From PCS 7 V8.2, the SIMATIC Logic Matrix supports the generation of the required operations with an interface.

Generating logical operations with the Logic Matrix offers the following advantages:

- Clear generation of logical operations with the Logic Matrix Editor.
- Easy to amend and optimize the logical operations.
- Clear representation of the logical operations in the OS runtime.
- Filter options for quickly locating the cause of interlocking in the OS runtime.

Note

You will find detailed information on the SIMATIC Logic Matrix in the application example ""Efficient engineering of interlocking with PCS 7 Logic Matrix"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482621) and in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Logic Matrix"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748784) manual.
