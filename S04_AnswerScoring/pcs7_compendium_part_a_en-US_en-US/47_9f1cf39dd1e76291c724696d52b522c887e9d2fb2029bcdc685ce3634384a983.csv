1. Select a subproject to serve as a template. In general, the PH settings should be uniform throughout the multiproject in PCS 7.
2. The number of hierarchy levels should remain set to 8, since for example the optional ""Derive diagnostic screens from the plant hierarchy"" asset management function can automatically generate up to 8 levels.
3. You can use the ""OS area"" option to determine the level from which the PH is displayed in the OS. The default setting is for the first level as in the example.
