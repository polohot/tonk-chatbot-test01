Industry-neutral example: 2550C01CA04

- 25: Short designation of the production facility
- 50: Name of the control room
- C01C: Name and position of the rack
- A04: Module slot

Industry-specific example based on the water industry: RN-LISA-04

Adhere to the following convention for the names of the individual process tags:

XXN_XXXX_XX

- XXN: Process step
- XXXX: Measuring principle:
- XX: Element

According to the ATV260 guideline, the name of the process step must be shortened to two characters, e.g. RB for rain overflow basin.

# Naming concept

The names of IO devices and DP slaves should be based on the naming concept of a plant or plant network to allow you to quickly localize the location of a problem during maintenance. Industry-neutral as well as industry-specific names exist for this.

Industry-neutral example: 2550C01CA04

- 25: Short designation of the production facility
- 50: Name of the control room
- C01C: Name and position of the rack
- A04: Module slot

Industry-specific example based on the water industry: RN-LISA-04
