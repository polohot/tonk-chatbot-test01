# 11.2 Complete online download to a redundant OS server pair

# Introduction

You always need to perform a complete download for the initial loading or after performing substantial changes.

# Procedure

The following steps must be taken to download the entire program during operation while retaining data archiving:

1. Compile the OS project (in full or changes only).
2. Download the OS project in full from the ES to the OS servers. The OS runtime on the target station is deactivated automatically with this and the project is closed. The OS runtime is reactivated automatically once the download has completed.
3. After activation, the redundancy manager starts to synchronize the data of the two redundant OS servers. Wait until the process control message ""REDRT:Archive update complete"" appears.
4. Next download the standby OS. The server already loaded becomes the ""Master"" again. The OS clients switch over again.

# 11.2 Complete online download to a redundant OS server pair

# Introduction

You always need to perform a complete download for the initial loading or after performing substantial changes.

# Procedure

The following steps must be taken to download the entire program during operation while retaining data archiving:

1. Compile the OS project (in full or changes only).
2. Download the OS project in full from the ES to the OS servers. The OS runtime on the target station is deactivated automatically with this and the project is closed. The OS runtime is reactivated automatically once the download has completed.
3. After activation, the redundancy manager starts to synchronize the data of the two redundant OS servers. Wait until the process control message ""REDRT:Archive update complete"" appears.
4. Next download the standby OS. The server already loaded becomes the ""Master"" again. The OS clients switch over again.

# 11.2 Complete online download to a redundant OS server pair

# Introduction

You always need to perform a complete download for the initial loading or after performing substantial changes.

# Procedure

The following steps must be taken to download the entire program during operation while retaining data archiving:

1. Compile the OS project (in full or changes only).
2. Download the OS project in full from the ES to the OS servers. The OS runtime on the target station is deactivated automatically with this and the project is closed. The OS runtime is reactivated automatically once the download has completed.
3. After activation, the redundancy manager starts to synchronize the data of the two redundant OS servers. Wait until the process control message ""REDRT:Archive update complete"" appears.
4. Next download the standby OS. The server already loaded becomes the ""Master"" again. The OS clients switch over again.

# Introduction

You always need to perform a complete download for the initial loading or after performing substantial changes.

# Procedure

The following steps must be taken to download the entire program during operation while retaining data archiving:

1. Compile the OS project (in full or changes only).
2. Download the OS project in full from the ES to the OS servers. The OS runtime on the target station is deactivated automatically with this and the project is closed. The OS runtime is reactivated automatically once the download has completed.
3. After activation, the redundancy manager starts to synchronize the data of the two redundant OS servers. Wait until the process control message ""REDRT:Archive update complete"" appears.
4. Next download the standby OS. The server already loaded becomes the ""Master"" again. The OS clients switch over again.

# 11.1.2 Central dialog ""Compile and Download Objects""

The ""Compile and Download Objects” dialog box can be used to update all SIMATIC stations
automatically, one after the other.

The settings for compiling changes and for downloading changes are made separately for
the relevant objects via the ""Edit"" button. This calls up the dialogs described in Section
""Compiling and downloading in stages (Page 306)"".

The ""Test"" button can be used to check the consistency of the settings prior to starting the
automatic process.

When changes are downloaded to the OS servers, the OS clients are also updated, as they
receive the new server data.

Recommendations for the quantity structure

Only configuring and downloading manageable changes (between 10 and 30 process objects) is recommended for downloading changes online. Downloading changes online is not suitable for transferring mass data but is instead designed for inserting new measuring points or measuring point changes into a project.

# Permitted actions for downloading changes to the OS

An overview of the points where changes can be made can be found in the section ""Downloading Changes to a Project"" in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# 11.2 Complete online download to a redundant OS server pair

# Introduction

You always need to perform a complete download for the initial loading or after performing substantial changes.

# Procedure

The following steps must be taken to download the entire program during operation while retaining data archiving:

1. Compile the OS project (in full or changes only).
2. Download the OS project in full from the ES to the OS servers. The OS runtime on the target station is deactivated automatically with this and the project is closed. The OS runtime is reactivated automatically once the download has completed.
3. After activation, the redundancy manager starts to synchronize the data of the two redundant OS servers. Wait until the process control message ""REDRT:Archive update complete"" appears.
4. Next download the standby OS. The server already loaded becomes the ""Master"" again. The OS clients switch over again.
