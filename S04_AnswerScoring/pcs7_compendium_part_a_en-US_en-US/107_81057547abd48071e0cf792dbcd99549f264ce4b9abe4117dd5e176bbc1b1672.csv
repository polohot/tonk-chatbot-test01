# Configuring OS functions

# 10.9 User administration

Note

Only the groups in the ""User Administration"" Editor should be created for SIMATIC PCS 7 OS.

The names of the newly created user groups must be written in exactly the same way in the Windows operating system and the OS User Administrator. These names are case-sensitive.

Users are only created in the operating system of the logon computer. Once a user has successfully logged on via the logon computer, authorizations are then assigned to that user in the OS.

The following SIMATIC PCS 7 system components can also use SIMATIC Logon in addition to the SIMATIC PCS 7 OS:

- SIMATIC PCS 7 OS
- SIMATIC BATCH
- SIMATIC Route Control
- SIMATIC Manager
- Automation License Manager

# License

The license for SIMATIC Logon is integrated in PCS 7 in version V7.1 and above. A master license is automatically generated on the system when SIMATIC PCS 7 is installed using the general setup program.

# 10.10 Downloading the OS projects

# Requirement

The following requirements must be fulfilled in order to load OS projects:

- Required target path authorizations are set.
- The logged-on user must be a member of the Windows user group ""SIMATIC HMI"".

Note

You can find details regarding the requirements for downloading OS projects in the ""Downloading and activating a project"" section of the ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# Procedure

By and large, individual OS projects, OS servers, and OS clients are downloaded in the same way. This is illustrated below, using SERVER1A as an example.

1. In the component view, select the OS object you want to download, then select the ""PLC > Download"" menu command.

NOTICE

In PCS 7 this is the only permissible method of downloading OS projects to the target computer. Using the WinCC Project Duplicator is expressly forbidden. You can find more details on configuring the Windows user authorizations in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 – PC Configuration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.

# Requirement

The following requirements must be fulfilled in order to load OS projects:

- Required target path authorizations are set.
- The logged-on user must be a member of the Windows user group ""SIMATIC HMI"".

Note

You can find details regarding the requirements for downloading OS projects in the ""Downloading and activating a project"" section of the ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# Procedure

By and large, individual OS projects, OS servers, and OS clients are downloaded in the same way. This is illustrated below, using SERVER1A as an example.

1. In the component view, select the OS object you want to download, then select the ""PLC > Download"" menu command.

NOTICE

In PCS 7 this is the only permissible method of downloading OS projects to the target computer. Using the WinCC Project Duplicator is expressly forbidden.

# Requirement

The following requirements must be fulfilled in order to load OS projects:

- Required target path authorizations are set.
- The logged-on user must be a member of the Windows user group ""SIMATIC HMI"".

Note

You can find details regarding the requirements for downloading OS projects in the ""Downloading and activating a project"" section of the ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.9 User administration

Note

Only the groups in the ""User Administration"" Editor should be created for SIMATIC PCS 7 OS.

The names of the newly created user groups must be written in exactly the same way in the Windows operating system and the OS User Administrator. These names are case-sensitive.

Users are only created in the operating system of the logon computer. Once a user has successfully logged on via the logon computer, authorizations are then assigned to that user in the OS.

The following SIMATIC PCS 7 system components can also use SIMATIC Logon in addition to the SIMATIC PCS 7 OS:

- SIMATIC PCS 7 OS
- SIMATIC BATCH
- SIMATIC Route Control
- SIMATIC Manager
- Automation License Manager

# License

The license for SIMATIC Logon is integrated in PCS 7 in version V7.1 and above. A master license is automatically generated on the system when SIMATIC PCS 7 is installed using the general setup program.

# Requirement

The following requirements must be fulfilled in order to load OS projects:

- Required target path authorizations are set.
- The logged-on user must be a member of the Windows user group ""SIMATIC HMI"".

Note

You can find details regarding the requirements for downloading OS projects in the ""Downloading and activating a project"" section of the ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# Procedure

By and large, individual OS projects, OS servers, and OS clients are downloaded in the same way. This is illustrated below, using SERVER1A as an example.

1. In the component view, select the OS object you want to download, then select the ""PLC > Download"" menu command.

NOTICE

In PCS 7 this is the only permissible method of downloading OS projects to the target computer. Using the WinCC Project Duplicator is expressly forbidden. You can find more details on configuring the Windows user authorizations in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 – PC Configuration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.
