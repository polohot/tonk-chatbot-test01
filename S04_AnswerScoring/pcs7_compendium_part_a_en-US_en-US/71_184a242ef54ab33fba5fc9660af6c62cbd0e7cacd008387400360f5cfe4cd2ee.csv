1. Select the ""Install GSD File"" command from the ""Options"" menu.
2. Select the GSD directory and install the selected GSD.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)

1. Select the ""Install GSD File"" command from the ""Options"" menu.
2. Select the GSD directory and install the selected GSD.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

# Example

For this example, the network configuration is as follows:

- 2 AS

- 1 redundant OS server pair
- 4 OS clients

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

# 6.8 Integrating field devices

Once SIMATIC PDM has been opened, on the ""Device"" tab found under “Device > Object Properties"" you can define the storage folder and revision level of the EDD file corresponding to the device.

You can occasionally procure later EDDs for field devices from the field device manufacturer. The EDDs can be conveniently imported through the ""SIMATIC PDM/Device Integration Manager"".

An EDD device description may contain the following components:

- Device description (EDD file)
- Lexicon/user languages
- Help files (relating to function and operation)
- Manuals (technical documentation)
- Communication description (GSD file)
- Images / graphics

# Diagnostic support for field devices

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the network connections

# Example

For this example, the network configuration is as follows:

- 2 AS
- 1 ES
- 1 redundant OS server pair
- 4 OS clients

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 6.8 Integrating field devices

Once SIMATIC PDM has been opened, on the ""Device"" tab found under “Device > Object Properties"" you can define the storage folder and revision level of the EDD file corresponding to the device.

You can occasionally procure later EDDs for field devices from the field device manufacturer. The EDDs can be conveniently imported through the ""SIMATIC PDM/Device Integration Manager"".

An EDD device description may contain the following components:

- Device description (EDD file)
- Lexicon/user languages
- Help files (relating to function and operation)
- Manuals (technical documentation)
- Communication description (GSD file)
- Images / graphics

# Diagnostic support for field devices

PCS 7 automatically creates diagnostics drivers with the help of the module wizard for HART devices, PA devices with profile 3.0 and above, FF devices, PROFIBUS DP standard slaves and released modules.

Various add-ons are also supported, such as SIMOCODE PRO and DRIVE ES. When installed, these add-ons provide the action lists required to automatically create diagnostics drivers.

Diagnostics drivers can also be configured manually, but they must be created separately from the system charts.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

# 6.8 Integrating field devices

Once SIMATIC PDM has been opened, on the ""Device"" tab found under “Device > Object Properties"" you can define the storage folder and revision level of the EDD file corresponding to the device.

You can occasionally procure later EDDs for field devices from the field device manufacturer. The EDDs can be conveniently imported through the ""SIMATIC PDM/Device Integration Manager"".

An EDD device description may contain the following components:

- Device description (EDD file)
- Lexicon/user languages
- Help files (relating to function and operation)
- Manuals (technical documentation)
- Communication description (GSD file)
- Images / graphics

# Diagnostic support for field devices

PCS 7 automatically creates diagnostics drivers with the help of the module wizard for HART devices, PA devices with profile 3.0 and above, FF devices, PROFIBUS DP standard slaves and released modules.

Various add-ons are also supported, such as SIMOCODE PRO and DRIVE ES. When installed, these add-ons provide the action lists required to automatically create diagnostics drivers.

Diagnostics drivers can also be configured manually, but they must be created separately from the system charts.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

# 6.8 Integrating field devices

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 6.8 Integrating field devices

Once SIMATIC PDM has been opened, on the ""Device"" tab found under “Device > Object Properties"" you can define the storage folder and revision level of the EDD file corresponding to the device.

You can occasionally procure later EDDs for field devices from the field device manufacturer. The EDDs can be conveniently imported through the ""SIMATIC PDM/Device Integration Manager"".

An EDD device description may contain the following components:

- Device description (EDD file)
- Lexicon/user languages
- Help files (relating to function and operation)
- Manuals (technical documentation)
- Communication description (GSD file)

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

# Example

For this example, the network configuration is as follows:

- 2 AS

- 1 redundant OS server pair
- 4 OS clients

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

- 4 OS clients

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Once SIMATIC PDM has been opened, on the ""Device"" tab found under “Device > Object Properties"" you can define the storage folder and revision level of the EDD file corresponding to the device.

You can occasionally procure later EDDs for field devices from the field device manufacturer. The EDDs can be conveniently imported through the ""SIMATIC PDM/Device Integration Manager"".

An EDD device description may contain the following components:

- Device description (EDD file)
- Lexicon/user languages
- Help files (relating to function and operation)

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

# Diagnostic support for field devices

PCS 7 automatically creates diagnostics drivers with the help of the module wizard for HART devices, PA devices with profile 3.0 and above, FF devices, PROFIBUS DP standard slaves and released modules.

Various add-ons are also supported, such as SIMOCODE PRO and DRIVE ES. When installed, these add-ons provide the action lists required to automatically create diagnostics drivers.

Diagnostics drivers can also be configured manually, but they must be created separately from the system charts.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Diagnostic support for field devices

PCS 7 automatically creates diagnostics drivers with the help of the module wizard for HART devices, PA devices with profile 3.0 and above, FF devices, PROFIBUS DP standard slaves and released modules.

Various add-ons are also supported, such as SIMOCODE PRO and DRIVE ES. When installed, these add-ons provide the action lists required to automatically create diagnostics drivers.

Diagnostics drivers can also be configured manually, but they must be created separately from the system charts.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the network connections

# Example

For this example, the network configuration is as follows:

- 2 AS
- 1 ES
- 1 redundant OS server pair
- 4 OS clients

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 6.8 Integrating field devices

Once SIMATIC PDM has been opened, on the ""Device"" tab found under “Device > Object Properties"" you can define the storage folder and revision level of the EDD file corresponding to the device.

You can occasionally procure later EDDs for field devices from the field device manufacturer. The EDDs can be conveniently imported through the ""SIMATIC PDM/Device Integration Manager"".

An EDD device description may contain the following components:

- Device description (EDD file)
- Lexicon/user languages
- Help files (relating to function and operation)
- Manuals (technical documentation)
- Communication description (GSD file)

This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled.

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

# Example

For this example, the network configuration is as follows:

- 2 AS

- 1 redundant OS server pair
- 4 OS clients

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

# 6.8 Integrating field devices

Once SIMATIC PDM has been opened, on the ""Device"" tab found under “Device > Object Properties"" you can define the storage folder and revision level of the EDD file corresponding to the device.

You can occasionally procure later EDDs for field devices from the field device manufacturer. The EDDs can be conveniently imported through the ""SIMATIC PDM/Device Integration Manager"".

An EDD device description may contain the following components:

- Device description (EDD file)
- Lexicon/user languages
- Help files (relating to function and operation)
- Manuals (technical documentation)
- Communication description (GSD file)

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

# Example

For this example, the network configuration is as follows:

- 2 AS

- 1 redundant OS server pair
- 4 OS clients

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Once SIMATIC PDM has been opened, on the ""Device"" tab found under “Device > Object Properties"" you can define the storage folder and revision level of the EDD file corresponding to the device.

You can occasionally procure later EDDs for field devices from the field device manufacturer. The EDDs can be conveniently imported through the ""SIMATIC PDM/Device Integration Manager"".

An EDD device description may contain the following components:

- Device description (EDD file)
- Lexicon/user languages
- Help files (relating to function and operation)
- Manuals (technical documentation)

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

2. Select the GSD directory and install the selected GSD.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

You will find further information on the individual components, integration, commissioning, operation, and maintenance in the operating instructions ""SIMATIC Bus link Extended fieldbus diagnostics in PROFIBUS PA” (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/88994694).

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project ""01_Plant_A"" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

2. Select the GSD directory and install the selected GSD.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the ""Device Integration Manager"" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 6.8 Integrating field devices

Once SIMATIC PDM has been opened, on the ""Device"" tab found under “Device > Object Properties"" you can define the storage folder and revision level of the EDD file corresponding to the device.

You can occasionally procure later EDDs for field devices from the field device manufacturer. The EDDs can be conveniently imported through the ""SIMATIC PDM/Device Integration Manager"".

An EDD device description may contain the following components:

- Device description (EDD file)
- Lexicon/user languages
- Help files (relating to function and operation)
- Manuals (technical documentation)
- Communication description (GSD file)
- Images / graphics
