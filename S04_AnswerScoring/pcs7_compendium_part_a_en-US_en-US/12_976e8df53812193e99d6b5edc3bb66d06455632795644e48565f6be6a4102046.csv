# 4.3.2 Hard disk distribution

# Introduction

The following chart shows an example of how a PC station hard disk can be distributed:

|drive|Name|Size|Format|Note|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|C:|SYSTEM|Recommendation: > 100GB|NTFS|Installation of Operat- ing System and PCS 7|
|D:|DATA|Recommendation: > 100GB|NTFS|PCS 7 project data|
|I:|IMAGES|Optional|NTFS|Backup files (including potentially via the network)|

Note

The Microsoft SQL Server stores temporary files on the ""C:"" drive. Therefore, you should regularly check whether enough hard disk space is available, especially during the FAT. You can find additional information on the hard disk distribution in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 – PC Configuration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.

# 4.3 Installation

# Licensing mode (Windows Server 2012 R2)

Ensure that the operating systems are licensed correctly on all PCS 7 stations and that adequate Microsoft Client Access licenses (CAL) are available for accessing a Windows server operating system via the network.

All stations with a Windows server operating system installed are set to ""Pro Server"" licensing mode in their control panel as standard.

Select the ""per device or per user"" option button for the licensing mode if more than one server or more than five clients are present in one area.

You can use the ""Licensing"" tool (Folder start menu &gt; Administrative Tools) to manage the CAL settings centrally from a Windows server in a network with multiple Windows servers.

Example configuration: Redundant OS server (2 servers), 5 OS clients, and 1 ES

|5 CALs|are available for each OS server|
|---|---|
|Each OS client or ES|requires 1 CAL|
|Available CALs|10 CALs (red. OS server)|
|Required CALs|5 CALs (OS clients) + 1 CAL (ES) = 6 CALs|
|Reserve|4 CALs|

Note
At a changeover to a newer Windows Server version (e.g. Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2), the CALs must also be adapted to the new version.

# Internet time

Ensure that the Windows system time is not automatically synchronized via the Internet where the PC stations are operated in a workgroup (Change date/time &gt; Internet time).

|---|---|---|---|---|
|C:|SYSTEM|Recommendation: > 100GB|NTFS|Installation of Operat- ing System and PCS 7|
|D:|DATA|Recommendation: > 100GB|NTFS|PCS 7 project data|
|I:|IMAGES|Optional|NTFS|Backup files (including potentially via the network)|

Note

The Microsoft SQL Server stores temporary files on the ""C:"" drive. Therefore, you should regularly check whether enough hard disk space is available, especially during the FAT.

# 4.3 Installation

# Licensing mode (Windows Server 2012 R2)

Ensure that the operating systems are licensed correctly on all PCS 7 stations and that adequate Microsoft Client Access licenses (CAL) are available for accessing a Windows server operating system via the network.

All stations with a Windows server operating system installed are set to ""Pro Server"" licensing mode in their control panel as standard.

Select the ""per device or per user"" option button for the licensing mode if more than one server or more than five clients are present in one area.

You can use the ""Licensing"" tool (Folder start menu &gt; Administrative Tools) to manage the CAL settings centrally from a Windows server in a network with multiple Windows servers.

Example configuration: Redundant OS server (2 servers), 5 OS clients, and 1 ES

|5 CALs|are available for each OS server|
|---|---|
|Each OS client or ES|requires 1 CAL|
|Available CALs|10 CALs (red. OS server)|
|Required CALs|5 CALs (OS clients) + 1 CAL (ES) = 6 CALs|
|Reserve|4 CALs|

Note
At a changeover to a newer Windows Server version (e.g. Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2), the CALs must also be adapted to the new version.

# Licensing mode (Windows Server 2012 R2)

Ensure that the operating systems are licensed correctly on all PCS 7 stations and that adequate Microsoft Client Access licenses (CAL) are available for accessing a Windows server operating system via the network.

All stations with a Windows server operating system installed are set to ""Pro Server"" licensing mode in their control panel as standard.

Select the ""per device or per user"" option button for the licensing mode if more than one server or more than five clients are present in one area.

You can use the ""Licensing"" tool (Folder start menu &gt; Administrative Tools) to manage the CAL settings centrally from a Windows server in a network with multiple Windows servers.

Example configuration: Redundant OS server (2 servers), 5 OS clients, and 1 ES

|5 CALs|are available for each OS server|
|---|---|
|Each OS client or ES|requires 1 CAL|
|Available CALs|10 CALs (red. OS server)|
|Required CALs|5 CALs (OS clients) + 1 CAL (ES) = 6 CALs|
|Reserve|4 CALs|

Note
At a changeover to a newer Windows Server version (e.g. Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2), the CALs must also be adapted to the new version.

# Licensing mode (Windows Server 2012 R2)

Ensure that the operating systems are licensed correctly on all PCS 7 stations and that adequate Microsoft Client Access licenses (CAL) are available for accessing a Windows server operating system via the network.

All stations with a Windows server operating system installed are set to ""Pro Server"" licensing mode in their control panel as standard.

Select the ""per device or per user"" option button for the licensing mode if more than one server or more than five clients are present in one area.

You can use the ""Licensing"" tool (Folder start menu &gt; Administrative Tools) to manage the CAL settings centrally from a Windows server in a network with multiple Windows servers.

Example configuration: Redundant OS server (2 servers), 5 OS clients, and 1 ES

|5 CALs|are available for each OS server|
|---|---|
|Each OS client or ES|requires 1 CAL|
|Available CALs|10 CALs (red. OS server)|
|Required CALs|5 CALs (OS clients) + 1 CAL (ES) = 6 CALs|
|Reserve|4 CALs|

Note
At a changeover to a newer Windows Server version (e.g. Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2), the CALs must also be adapted to the new version.

# 4.3.2 Hard disk distribution

# Introduction

The following chart shows an example of how a PC station hard disk can be distributed:

|drive|Name|Size|Format|Note|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|C:|SYSTEM|Recommendation: > 100GB|NTFS|Installation of Operat- ing System and PCS 7|
|D:|DATA|Recommendation: > 100GB|NTFS|PCS 7 project data|
|I:|IMAGES|Optional|NTFS|Backup files (including potentially via the network)|

Note

The Microsoft SQL Server stores temporary files on the ""C:"" drive. Therefore, you should regularly check whether enough hard disk space is available, especially during the FAT. You can find additional information on the hard disk distribution in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 – PC Configuration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.

# Licensing mode (Windows Server 2012 R2)

Ensure that the operating systems are licensed correctly on all PCS 7 stations and that adequate Microsoft Client Access licenses (CAL) are available for accessing a Windows server operating system via the network.

All stations with a Windows server operating system installed are set to ""Pro Server"" licensing mode in their control panel as standard.

Select the ""per device or per user"" option button for the licensing mode if more than one server or more than five clients are present in one area.

You can use the ""Licensing"" tool (Folder start menu &gt; Administrative Tools) to manage the CAL settings centrally from a Windows server in a network with multiple Windows servers.

Example configuration: Redundant OS server (2 servers), 5 OS clients, and 1 ES

|5 CALs|are available for each OS server|
|---|---|
|Each OS client or ES|requires 1 CAL|
|Available CALs|10 CALs (red. OS server)|
|Required CALs|5 CALs (OS clients) + 1 CAL (ES) = 6 CALs|
|Reserve|4 CALs|

Note
At a changeover to a newer Windows Server version (e.g. Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2), the CALs must also be adapted to the new version.

# Internet time

Ensure that the Windows system time is not automatically synchronized via the Internet where the PC stations are operated in a workgroup (Change date/time &gt; Internet time).

# 4.3 Installation

# Licensing mode (Windows Server 2012 R2)

Ensure that the operating systems are licensed correctly on all PCS 7 stations and that adequate Microsoft Client Access licenses (CAL) are available for accessing a Windows server operating system via the network.

All stations with a Windows server operating system installed are set to ""Pro Server"" licensing mode in their control panel as standard.

Select the ""per device or per user"" option button for the licensing mode if more than one server or more than five clients are present in one area.

You can use the ""Licensing"" tool (Folder start menu &gt; Administrative Tools) to manage the CAL settings centrally from a Windows server in a network with multiple Windows servers.

Example configuration: Redundant OS server (2 servers), 5 OS clients, and 1 ES

|5 CALs|are available for each OS server|
|---|---|
|Each OS client or ES|requires 1 CAL|
|Available CALs|10 CALs (red. OS server)|
|Required CALs|5 CALs (OS clients) + 1 CAL (ES) = 6 CALs|
|Reserve|4 CALs|

Note
At a changeover to a newer Windows Server version (e.g. Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2), the CALs must also be adapted to the new version.

# Internet time

Ensure that the Windows system time is not automatically synchronized via the Internet where the PC stations are operated in a workgroup (Change date/time &gt; Internet time).

# 4.3.2 Hard disk distribution

# Introduction

The following chart shows an example of how a PC station hard disk can be distributed:

|drive|Name|Size|Format|Note|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|C:|SYSTEM|Recommendation: > 100GB|NTFS|Installation of Operat- ing System and PCS 7|
|D:|DATA|Recommendation: > 100GB|NTFS|PCS 7 project data|
|I:|IMAGES|Optional|NTFS|Backup files (including potentially via the network)|

Note

The Microsoft SQL Server stores temporary files on the ""C:"" drive. Therefore, you should regularly check whether enough hard disk space is available, especially during the FAT. You can find additional information on the hard disk distribution in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 – PC Configuration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.

# Preparation and administration

# 4.3 Installation

# Licensing mode (Windows Server 2012 R2)

Ensure that the operating systems are licensed correctly on all PCS 7 stations and that adequate Microsoft Client Access licenses (CAL) are available for accessing a Windows server operating system via the network.

All stations with a Windows server operating system installed are set to ""Pro Server"" licensing mode in their control panel as standard.

Select the ""per device or per user"" option button for the licensing mode if more than one server or more than five clients are present in one area.

You can use the ""Licensing"" tool (Folder start menu &gt; Administrative Tools) to manage the CAL settings centrally from a Windows server in a network with multiple Windows servers.

Example configuration: Redundant OS server (2 servers), 5 OS clients, and 1 ES

|5 CALs|are available for each OS server|
|---|---|
|Each OS client or ES|requires 1 CAL|
|Available CALs|10 CALs (red. OS server)|
|Required CALs|5 CALs (OS clients) + 1 CAL (ES) = 6 CALs|
|Reserve|4 CALs|

Note
At a changeover to a newer Windows Server version (e.g. Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2), the CALs must also be adapted to the new version.
