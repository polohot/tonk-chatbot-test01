# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.8 System Registration – System ID

A new service concept was introduced with SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0, which is based on a system-specific system identification number – the System ID (SID).

The System ID is generated once when you register your new system for free at www.siemens.com/SIDregistry and is stored centrally at Siemens Technical Support. It then serves as the unique identification of your PCS 7 system over its entire life cycle.

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The ""Determine inventory data"" and ""Export inventory data"" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

Note

You can find additional information on determining the inventory data in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" manual.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.8 System Registration – System ID

A new service concept was introduced with SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0, which is based on a system-specific system identification number – the System ID (SID).

The System ID is generated once when you register your new system for free at www.siemens.com/SIDregistry and is stored centrally at Siemens Technical Support. It then serves as the unique identification of your PCS 7 system over its entire life cycle.

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The ""Determine inventory data"" and ""Export inventory data"" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

Note

You can find additional information on determining the inventory data in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" manual.

This section describes the settings in the hardware configuration (HW Config) of the example project (""Comp_MP"").
The screenshots provide an overview of the properties of the following configurations:

- H-system with CPU 410-5H and CP 443-1/CP 443-5 Ext.
- Standard AS with a CPU 410-5H and CP 443-1/CP 443-5 Ext.

For other CPUs or CPs, the properties dialog boxes may differ slightly. Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:
S7-400 CPUs firmware version 5.1 and higher and Win AC RTX software version V4.6 and higher support dataset routing to the internal PROFIBUS DP interface.
For this purpose, the CPUs must also be configured in this firmware version. For all other S7-400 CPUs, the required routing functions must be implemented with a CP 443-5 Ext.

# 6.1 General CPU settings (H system and standard AS)

PCS 7 features optimized default settings for a CPU so that only a few parameters need to be set for a given project.
Detailed information on the parameters can be found in the HW Config online help. Special contexts for PCS 7 are explained in greater detail in the following sub-sections.
These subsections also contain relevant recommendations, the parameters to be left at their default settings, and the parameters you may need to adapt to your particular project.

CPU parameters highlighted in blue can be changed during operation on an H system. All special information for the CPU settings in the H system is given in the section titled ""Special settings for an H system"".

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The ""Determine inventory data"" and ""Export inventory data"" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

# Introduction

This section describes the settings in the hardware configuration (HW Config) of the example project (""Comp_MP"").
The screenshots provide an overview of the properties of the following configurations:

- H-system with CPU 410-5H and CP 443-1/CP 443-5 Ext.
- Standard AS with a CPU 410-5H and CP 443-1/CP 443-5 Ext.

For other CPUs or CPs, the properties dialog boxes may differ slightly. Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:
S7-400 CPUs firmware version 5.1 and higher and Win AC RTX software version V4.6 and higher support dataset routing to the internal PROFIBUS DP interface.
For this purpose, the CPUs must also be configured in this firmware version. For all other S7-400 CPUs, the required routing functions must be implemented with a CP 443-5 Ext.

# 6.1 General CPU settings (H system and standard AS)

PCS 7 features optimized default settings for a CPU so that only a few parameters need to be set for a given project.
Detailed information on the parameters can be found in the HW Config online help. Special contexts for PCS 7 are explained in greater detail in the following sub-sections.
These subsections also contain relevant recommendations, the parameters to be left at their default settings, and the parameters you may need to adapt to your particular project.

CPU parameters highlighted in blue can be changed during operation on an H system. All special information for the CPU settings in the H system is given in the section titled ""Special settings for an H system"".

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.8 System Registration – System ID

A new service concept was introduced with SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0, which is based on a system-specific system identification number – the System ID (SID).

The System ID is generated once when you register your new system for free at www.siemens.com/SIDregistry and is stored centrally at Siemens Technical Support. It then serves as the unique identification of your PCS 7 system over its entire life cycle.

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The ""Determine inventory data"" and ""Export inventory data"" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

# 5.8 System Registration – System ID

A new service concept was introduced with SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0, which is based on a system-specific system identification number – the System ID (SID).

The System ID is generated once when you register your new system for free at www.siemens.com/SIDregistry and is stored centrally at Siemens Technical Support. It then serves as the unique identification of your PCS 7 system over its entire life cycle.

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The ""Determine inventory data"" and ""Export inventory data"" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

Note

You can find additional information on determining the inventory data in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" manual.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.8 System Registration – System ID

A new service concept was introduced with SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0, which is based on a system-specific system identification number – the System ID (SID).

The System ID is generated once when you register your new system for free at www.siemens.com/SIDregistry and is stored centrally at Siemens Technical Support. It then serves as the unique identification of your PCS 7 system over its entire life cycle.

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The ""Determine inventory data"" and ""Export inventory data"" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

Note

You can find additional information on determining the inventory data in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" manual.

A new service concept was introduced with SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0, which is based on a system-specific system identification number – the System ID (SID).

The System ID is generated once when you register your new system for free at www.siemens.com/SIDregistry and is stored centrally at Siemens Technical Support. It then serves as the unique identification of your PCS 7 system over its entire life cycle.

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The ""Determine inventory data"" and ""Export inventory data"" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

Note

You can find additional information on determining the inventory data in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" manual.

# Configuration of the hardware (AS and I/O)

# Introduction

This section describes the settings in the hardware configuration (HW Config) of the example project (""Comp_MP"").
The screenshots provide an overview of the properties of the following configurations:

- H-system with CPU 410-5H and CP 443-1/CP 443-5 Ext.
- Standard AS with a CPU 410-5H and CP 443-1/CP 443-5 Ext.

For other CPUs or CPs, the properties dialog boxes may differ slightly. Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:
S7-400 CPUs firmware version 5.1 and higher and Win AC RTX software version V4.6 and higher support dataset routing to the internal PROFIBUS DP interface.
For this purpose, the CPUs must also be configured in this firmware version. For all other S7-400 CPUs, the required routing functions must be implemented with a CP 443-5 Ext.

# 6.1 General CPU settings (H system and standard AS)

PCS 7 features optimized default settings for a CPU so that only a few parameters need to be set for a given project.
Detailed information on the parameters can be found in the HW Config online help. Special contexts for PCS 7 are explained in greater detail in the following sub-sections.
These subsections also contain relevant recommendations, the parameters to be left at their default settings, and the parameters you may need to adapt to your particular project.

CPU parameters highlighted in blue can be changed during operation on an H system. All special information for the CPU settings in the H system is given in the section titled ""Special settings for an H system"".
The following settings are made in the object properties of the CPU in HW Config.

The screenshots provide an overview of the properties of the following configurations:

- H-system with CPU 410-5H and CP 443-1/CP 443-5 Ext.
- Standard AS with a CPU 410-5H and CP 443-1/CP 443-5 Ext.

For other CPUs or CPs, the properties dialog boxes may differ slightly. Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:
S7-400 CPUs firmware version 5.1 and higher and Win AC RTX software version V4.6 and higher support dataset routing to the internal PROFIBUS DP interface.
For this purpose, the CPUs must also be configured in this firmware version. For all other S7-400 CPUs, the required routing functions must be implemented with a CP 443-5 Ext.

# 6.1 General CPU settings (H system and standard AS)

PCS 7 features optimized default settings for a CPU so that only a few parameters need to be set for a given project.
Detailed information on the parameters can be found in the HW Config online help. Special contexts for PCS 7 are explained in greater detail in the following sub-sections.
These subsections also contain relevant recommendations, the parameters to be left at their default settings, and the parameters you may need to adapt to your particular project.

CPU parameters highlighted in blue can be changed during operation on an H system. All special information for the CPU settings in the H system is given in the section titled ""Special settings for an H system"".
The following settings are made in the object properties of the CPU in HW Config.

# 5.8 System Registration – System ID

A new service concept was introduced with SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0, which is based on a system-specific system identification number – the System ID (SID).

The System ID is generated once when you register your new system for free at www.siemens.com/SIDregistry and is stored centrally at Siemens Technical Support. It then serves as the unique identification of your PCS 7 system over its entire life cycle.

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The ""Determine inventory data"" and ""Export inventory data"" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

You can find additional information on determining the inventory data in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" manual.

# 5.8 System Registration – System ID

A new service concept was introduced with SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0, which is based on a system-specific system identification number – the System ID (SID).

The System ID is generated once when you register your new system for free at www.siemens.com/SIDregistry and is stored centrally at Siemens Technical Support. It then serves as the unique identification of your PCS 7 system over its entire life cycle.

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The ""Determine inventory data"" and ""Export inventory data"" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

In order for the required Sybase server to run on the central server computer, a user must be logged in on the central server computer. In order to remove this condition, you can set up the Sybase server as a service using the ""setsybserv.exe"" application. You can find extensive information on this in the section ""This is how you prepare the engineering station for multi-user operation"" in the ""SIMATIC PCS 7 PC – Configuration"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.

Parallel working on a project via a combined network is restricted to CFC and SFC. Specific improvements were implemented in CFC and SFC, including failsafe functions to safeguard system integrity and data consistency when several users access the same data at the same time.

Starting with PCS 7 V8.1, when a CFC chart is opened, the user receives the message ""Chart is being edited"" if another editor has already opened this chart. From PCS 7 version V8.1 onwards, the OS station can be opened and edited remotely by all connected engineering stations. The individual editors or images can only be opened by one user simultaneously in each case. Sometimes a ""read only"" mode is also possible for looking at the configured data if editors are already opened.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.8 System Registration – System ID

A new service concept was introduced with SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0, which is based on a system-specific system identification number – the System ID (SID).

The System ID is generated once when you register your new system for free at www.siemens.com/SIDregistry and is stored centrally at Siemens Technical Support. It then serves as the unique identification of your PCS 7 system over its entire life cycle.

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The ""Determine inventory data"" and ""Export inventory data"" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

Note

You can find additional information on determining the inventory data in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console"" manual.

# Configuration of the hardware (AS and I/O)

# Introduction

This section describes the settings in the hardware configuration (HW Config) of the example project (""Comp_MP"").
The screenshots provide an overview of the properties of the following configurations:

- H-system with CPU 410-5H and CP 443-1/CP 443-5 Ext.
- Standard AS with a CPU 410-5H and CP 443-1/CP 443-5 Ext.

For other CPUs or CPs, the properties dialog boxes may differ slightly. Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:
S7-400 CPUs firmware version 5.1 and higher and Win AC RTX software version V4.6 and higher support dataset routing to the internal PROFIBUS DP interface.
For this purpose, the CPUs must also be configured in this firmware version. For all other S7-400 CPUs, the required routing functions must be implemented with a CP 443-5 Ext.

# 6.1 General CPU settings (H system and standard AS)

PCS 7 features optimized default settings for a CPU so that only a few parameters need to be set for a given project.
Detailed information on the parameters can be found in the HW Config online help. Special contexts for PCS 7 are explained in greater detail in the following sub-sections.
These subsections also contain relevant recommendations, the parameters to be left at their default settings, and the parameters you may need to adapt to your particular project.

CPU parameters highlighted in blue can be changed during operation on an H system. All special information for the CPU settings in the H system is given in the section titled ""Special settings for an H system"".
The following settings are made in the object properties of the CPU in HW Config.
