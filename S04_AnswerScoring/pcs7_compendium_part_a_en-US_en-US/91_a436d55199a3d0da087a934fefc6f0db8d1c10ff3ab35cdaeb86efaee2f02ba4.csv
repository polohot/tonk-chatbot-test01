# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

The most important settings for an OS client server system are outlined in this section.

Note

You will find extensive information on the configuration of the OS functions, for example, central OS settings for keysets, in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# 10.1.1 Defining the server assignment

# Introduction

In order for a client to be able to display the process data from different servers in a distributed system, it needs information about the associated data. Server data (packages) are generated for this, to be provided to the clients. The client requires the server data from all servers, whose process information it should visualize.

The system creates/updates the server data automatically during OS compilation and download. Alternatively, the server data can be generated manually in the SIMATIC Manager using ""Generate server data"" in the context menu.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

The most important settings for an OS client server system are outlined in this section.

Note

You will find extensive information on the configuration of the OS functions, for example, central OS settings for keysets, in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# 10.1.1 Defining the server assignment

# Introduction

In order for a client to be able to display the process data from different servers in a distributed system, it needs information about the associated data. Server data (packages) are generated for this, to be provided to the clients. The client requires the server data from all servers, whose process information it should visualize.

The system creates/updates the server data automatically during OS compilation and download. Alternatively, the server data can be generated manually in the SIMATIC Manager using ""Generate server data"" in the context menu.

# 10.1.1 Defining the server assignment

# Introduction

In order for a client to be able to display the process data from different servers in a distributed system, it needs information about the associated data. Server data (packages) are generated for this, to be provided to the clients. The client requires the server data from all servers, whose process information it should visualize.

The system creates/updates the server data automatically during OS compilation and download. Alternatively, the server data can be generated manually in the SIMATIC Manager using ""Generate server data"" in the context menu.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

The most important settings for an OS client server system are outlined in this section.

Note

You will find extensive information on the configuration of the OS functions, for example, central OS settings for keysets, in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# 10.1.1 Defining the server assignment

# Introduction

In order for a client to be able to display the process data from different servers in a distributed system, it needs information about the associated data. Server data (packages) are generated for this, to be provided to the clients. The client requires the server data from all servers, whose process information it should visualize.

The system creates/updates the server data automatically during OS compilation and download. Alternatively, the server data can be generated manually in the SIMATIC Manager using ""Generate server data"" in the context menu.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

The most important settings for an OS client server system are outlined in this section.

Note

You will find extensive information on the configuration of the OS functions, for example, central OS settings for keysets, in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# 10.1.1 Defining the server assignment

# Introduction

In order for a client to be able to display the process data from different servers in a distributed system, it needs information about the associated data. Server data (packages) are generated for this, to be provided to the clients. The client requires the server data from all servers, whose process information it should visualize.

The system creates/updates the server data automatically during OS compilation and download. Alternatively, the server data can be generated manually in the SIMATIC Manager using ""Generate server data"" in the context menu.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

The most important settings for an OS client server system are outlined in this section.

Note

You will find extensive information on the configuration of the OS functions, for example, central OS settings for keysets, in the ""SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# 10.1.1 Defining the server assignment

# Introduction

In order for a client to be able to display the process data from different servers in a distributed system, it needs information about the associated data. Server data (packages) are generated for this, to be provided to the clients. The client requires the server data from all servers, whose process information it should visualize.

The system creates/updates the server data automatically during OS compilation and download. Alternatively, the server data can be generated manually in the SIMATIC Manager using ""Generate server data"" in the context menu.
