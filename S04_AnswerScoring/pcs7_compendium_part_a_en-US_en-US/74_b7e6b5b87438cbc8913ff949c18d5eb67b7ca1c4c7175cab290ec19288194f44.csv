# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

Introduction

Plant engineering gives rise to plant parts, functions or program sections which only differ from one another in a few respects. In the interests of working efficiently, create basic elements which can be reused repeatedly and which only have to be supplied with the current parameters. Once created these are managed in the master data library and used as an instance or replica in the AS assigned.

Note

All the information on configuring the AS functions can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual, from the ""Basic Engineering Concepts"" section.

Further information can also be found in the ""Technical Functions for the Chemical Industry"" application.

Adoption of existing base elements in the master data library

The following are available in PCS 7 as base elements for the purposes of reuse as an instance:

- Block type
Also referred below as a block.
- SFC type
- Process tag type
As an interface for the Import/Export Assistant
- Model
Models from completed hierarchy folder consisting of process tag types and of one or more process images
- Control module type (CMT)
Starting with PCS 7 V8.0 the type concept based on control module types is available. The control module type is referred to as CMT below. CMTs serve as an interface for the Plant Automatic Accelerator.

Note
The complete description of the base elements and their use can be found in the ""Typing, reuse and central changeability of engineering data"" section in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

Copy all required base elements from all libraries used for the configuration (e.g. PCS 7 AP Library) to the master data library of the multiproject (""Comp_LIB"" in this case). In the event that individual blocks should have changed attributes or names through the copying process then the following message is received. Calling up the ""Synchronize attributes"" function is recommended in this event so that no project-specific changes are lost in the master data library.

Note

When copying blocks observe the rules and notes in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual. Ensure that blocks are also copied that are opened as a multi-instance from other blocks, as the function of the block is not ensured otherwise.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

Introduction

Plant engineering gives rise to plant parts, functions or program sections which only differ from one another in a few respects. In the interests of working efficiently, create basic elements which can be reused repeatedly and which only have to be supplied with the current parameters. Once created these are managed in the master data library and used as an instance or replica in the AS assigned.

Note

All the information on configuring the AS functions can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual, from the ""Basic Engineering Concepts"" section.

Further information can also be found in the ""Technical Functions for the Chemical Industry"" application.

# 8.1.1 Master data library

Adoption of existing base elements in the master data library

The following are available in PCS 7 as base elements for the purposes of reuse as an instance:

- Block type
Also referred below as a block.
- SFC type
- Process tag type
As an interface for the Import/Export Assistant
- Model
Models from completed hierarchy folder consisting of process tag types and of one or more process images
- Control module type (CMT)
Starting with PCS 7 V8.0 the type concept based on control module types is available. The control module type is referred to as CMT below. CMTs serve as an interface for the Plant Automatic Accelerator.

Note
The complete description of the base elements and their use can be found in the ""Typing, reuse and central changeability of engineering data"" section in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

Copy all required base elements from all libraries used for the configuration (e.g. PCS 7 AP Library) to the master data library of the multiproject (""Comp_LIB"" in this case). In the event that individual blocks should have changed attributes or names through the copying process then the following message is received. Calling up the ""Synchronize attributes"" function is recommended in this event so that no project-specific changes are lost in the master data library.

Note

When copying blocks observe the rules and notes in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual. Ensure that blocks are also copied that are opened as a multi-instance from other blocks, as the function of the block is not ensured otherwise.

In the interests of working efficiently, create basic elements which can be reused repeatedly and which only have to be supplied with the current parameters. Once created these are managed in the master data library and used as an instance or replica in the AS assigned.

Note

All the information on configuring the AS functions can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual, from the ""Basic Engineering Concepts"" section.

Further information can also be found in the ""Technical Functions for the Chemical Industry"" application.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.1 Master data library

Adoption of existing base elements in the master data library

The following are available in PCS 7 as base elements for the purposes of reuse as an instance:

- Block type
Also referred below as a block.
- SFC type
- Process tag type
As an interface for the Import/Export Assistant
- Model
Models from completed hierarchy folder consisting of process tag types and of one or more process images
- Control module type (CMT)
Starting with PCS 7 V8.0 the type concept based on control module types is available. The control module type is referred to as CMT below. CMTs serve as an interface for the Plant Automatic Accelerator.

Note
The complete description of the base elements and their use can be found in the ""Typing, reuse and central changeability of engineering data"" section in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

Copy all required base elements from all libraries used for the configuration (e.g. PCS 7 AP Library) to the master data library of the multiproject (""Comp_LIB"" in this case). In the event that individual blocks should have changed attributes or names through the copying process then the following message is received. Calling up the ""Synchronize attributes"" function is recommended in this event so that no project-specific changes are lost in the master data library.

Note

When copying blocks observe the rules and notes in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual. Ensure that blocks are also copied that are opened as a multi-instance from other blocks, as the function of the block is not ensured otherwise.

# 8.1.1 Master data library

Adoption of existing base elements in the master data library

The following are available in PCS 7 as base elements for the purposes of reuse as an instance:

- Block type
Also referred below as a block.
- SFC type
- Process tag type
As an interface for the Import/Export Assistant
- Model
Models from completed hierarchy folder consisting of process tag types and of one or more process images
- Control module type (CMT)
Starting with PCS 7 V8.0 the type concept based on control module types is available. The control module type is referred to as CMT below. CMTs serve as an interface for the Plant Automatic Accelerator.

Note
The complete description of the base elements and their use can be found in the ""Typing, reuse and central changeability of engineering data"" section in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

Copy all required base elements from all libraries used for the configuration (e.g. PCS 7 AP Library) to the master data library of the multiproject (""Comp_LIB"" in this case). In the event that individual blocks should have changed attributes or names through the copying process then the following message is received. Calling up the ""Synchronize attributes"" function is recommended in this event so that no project-specific changes are lost in the master data library.

Note

When copying blocks observe the rules and notes in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual. Ensure that blocks are also copied that are opened as a multi-instance from other blocks, as the function of the block is not ensured otherwise.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

Introduction

Plant engineering gives rise to plant parts, functions or program sections which only differ from one another in a few respects. In the interests of working efficiently, create basic elements which can be reused repeatedly and which only have to be supplied with the current parameters. Once created these are managed in the master data library and used as an instance or replica in the AS assigned.

Note

All the information on configuring the AS functions can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual, from the ""Basic Engineering Concepts"" section.

Further information can also be found in the ""Technical Functions for the Chemical Industry"" application.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

Copy all required base elements from all libraries used for the configuration (e.g. PCS 7 AP Library) to the master data library of the multiproject (""Comp_LIB"" in this case). In the event that individual blocks should have changed attributes or names through the copying process then the following message is received. Calling up the ""Synchronize attributes"" function is recommended in this event so that no project-specific changes are lost in the master data library.

Note

When copying blocks observe the rules and notes in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual. Ensure that blocks are also copied that are opened as a multi-instance from other blocks, as the function of the block is not ensured otherwise.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

Introduction

Plant engineering gives rise to plant parts, functions or program sections which only differ from one another in a few respects. In the interests of working efficiently, create basic elements which can be reused repeatedly and which only have to be supplied with the current parameters. Once created these are managed in the master data library and used as an instance or replica in the AS assigned.

Note

All the information on configuring the AS functions can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual, from the ""Basic Engineering Concepts"" section.

# 8.1 Principles

Copy all required base elements from all libraries used for the configuration (e.g. PCS 7 AP Library) to the master data library of the multiproject (""Comp_LIB"" in this case). In the event that individual blocks should have changed attributes or names through the copying process then the following message is received. Calling up the ""Synchronize attributes"" function is recommended in this event so that no project-specific changes are lost in the master data library.

Note

When copying blocks observe the rules and notes in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual. Ensure that blocks are also copied that are opened as a multi-instance from other blocks, as the function of the block is not ensured otherwise.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

Introduction

Plant engineering gives rise to plant parts, functions or program sections which only differ from one another in a few respects. In the interests of working efficiently, create basic elements which can be reused repeatedly and which only have to be supplied with the current parameters. Once created these are managed in the master data library and used as an instance or replica in the AS assigned.

Note

All the information on configuring the AS functions can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual, from the ""Basic Engineering Concepts"" section.

Further information can also be found in the ""Technical Functions for the Chemical Industry"" application.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

Introduction

Plant engineering gives rise to plant parts, functions or program sections which only differ from one another in a few respects. In the interests of working efficiently, create basic elements which can be reused repeatedly and which only have to be supplied with the current parameters. Once created these are managed in the master data library and used as an instance or replica in the AS assigned.

Note

All the information on configuring the AS functions can be found in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"" manual, from the ""Basic Engineering Concepts"" section.
