This implies that NOx is dependent on Tc/T1 and P/P1, where T1 and P1 are the compressor inlet temperature and pressure, respectively, rather than the combustion temperature, Tc and pressure, P.\r\n\r\n# 6.18.2 CO correlations\r\n\r\nA correlation proposed by Lefebvre9 for the prediction of CO is given in Equation 6.20:\r\n\r\nCO = 86ma × Tpz × exp(– (0.00345 Tpz)/(Vc – Ve)(ΔP/P)0.5P1.5)\r\n\r\n[6.20]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n- Vc is the combustion volume, m3\r\n- Ve is the volume occupied by the evaporated fuel, m3\r\n- P is the combustion pressure, kPa\r\n- ΔP is the combustion non-dimensional pressure drop\r\n- ma is the combustion airflow, kg/s\r\n- Tpz is the average primary zone temperature, K\r\n\r\nCO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.\r\n\r\nThe following correlation similar to that proposed by Lefebvre is given by Rizk and Mongia12:\r\n\r\nCO = 0.179 × 109 exp(7800/Tpz)/P2(t – 0.4te)(ΔP/P)0.5\r\n\r\n[6.21]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n- t is the residence time in seconds and\r\n- te is the evaporation time in seconds\r\n- P is the combustion pressure, kPa\r\n- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.\r\n\r\nCO is calculated as an emissions index in g/kg of fuel.\r\n\r\n# 6.18.3 UHC correlation\r\n\r\nCorrelations for predicting UHC have been developed, but they tend to be less reliable than those developed for NOx and CO. However, Rizk and Mongia12 offer the following correlation for predicting UHC as an emissions index:\r\n\r\nUHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6\r\n\r\n[6.22]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n- t is the residence time in seconds and\r\n- te is the evaporation time in seconds\r\n- P is the combustion pressure, kPa\r\n- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.\r\n\r\n# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂\r\n\r\nThe equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:\r\n\r\nCxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.\r\n\r\nThe equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:\r\n\r\nn1 = x<br />\r\nn2 = 0.5y<br />\r\nn = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y\r\n\r\nSubstituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:\r\n\r\nCxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]\r\n\r\nTherefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:\r\n\r\n1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]\r\n\r\nValues of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.\r\n\r\nIf 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)\r\n\r\n# Gas turbine combustion\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n1. Hydrocarbon Fuels, Goodger, E.M., Macmillan Press (1975).\r\n",

However, Rizk and Mongia12 offer the following correlation for predicting UHC as an emissions index:\r\n\r\nUHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6\r\n\r\n[6.22]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n- t is the residence time in seconds and\r\n- te is the evaporation time in seconds\r\n- P is the combustion pressure, kPa\r\n- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.\r\n\r\n# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂\r\n\r\nThe equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:\r\n\r\nCxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.\r\n\r\nThe equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:\r\n\r\nn1 = x<br />\r\nn2 = 0.5y<br />\r\nn = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y\r\n\r\nSubstituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:\r\n\r\nCxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]\r\n\r\nTherefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:\r\n\r\n1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]\r\n\r\nValues of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.\r\n\r\nIf 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)\r\n\r\n# Gas turbine combustion\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n1. Hydrocarbon Fuels, Goodger, E.M., Macmillan Press (1975).\r\n",

However, Rizk and Mongia12 offer the following correlation for predicting UHC as an emissions index:\r\n\r\nUHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6\r\n\r\n[6.22]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n- t is the residence time in seconds and\r\n- te is the evaporation time in seconds\r\n- P is the combustion pressure, kPa\r\n- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.\r\n\r\n# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂\r\n\r\nThe equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:\r\n\r\nCxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.\r\n\r\nThe equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:\r\n\r\nn1 = x<br />\r\nn2 = 0.5y<br />\r\nn = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y\r\n\r\nSubstituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:\r\n\r\nCxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]\r\n\r\nTherefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:\r\n\r\n1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]\r\n\r\nValues of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.\r\n\r\nIf 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)\r\n\r\n# Gas turbine combustion\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n1. Hydrocarbon Fuels, Goodger, E.M., Macmillan Press (1975).\r\n",

However, Rizk and Mongia12 offer the following correlation for predicting UHC as an emissions index:\r\n\r\nUHC = 0.755 × 1011 exp(9756/Tpz)/P2.5(t – 0.35te)0.1 (ΔP/P)0.6\r\n\r\n[6.22]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n- t is the residence time in seconds and\r\n- te is the evaporation time in seconds\r\n- P is the combustion pressure, kPa\r\n- Tpz is the primary zone temperature, K.\r\n\r\n# 6.18.4 Calculation of CO₂\r\n\r\nThe equation governing the formation of CO2 during the burning of hydrocarbon fuels is given by:\r\n\r\nCxHy + nO2 = n1CO2 + n2H2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.23]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n- x/y is the carbon–hydrogen atomic ratio of the fuel.\r\n\r\nThe equation states that 1 molecule (mole) of the fuel will react with n moles of O2 to produce n1 moles of CO2 and n2 moles of H2O. Performing a molar balance:\r\n\r\nn1 = x<br />\r\nn2 = 0.5y<br />\r\nn = n1 + 0.5n2 = x + 0.25y\r\n\r\nSubstituting n, n1 and n2 into Equation 6.23:\r\n\r\nCxHy + (x + 0.25y)O2 = xCO2 + 0.5yH2O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.24]\r\n\r\nTherefore, 1 mole of fuel will produce x moles of CO2. But 1 mole of fuel will weigh x × 12 + y × 1 kg and 1 mole of CO2 will weigh 44 kg. Therefore:\r\n\r\n1 kg of fuel = 44 x/(12x + y) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.25]\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n1 kg of fuel = 44/(12 + y/x) kg of CO2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [6.26]\r\n\r\nValues of 44 and 12 in Equations 6.25 and 6.26 represent the molecular weight and atomic weight of CO2 and carbon, respectively. The atomic weight of hydrogen is, of course, unity.\r\n\r\nIf 1 kg of methane (CH4) whose x/y ratio is 0.25 is burnt, from Equation 6.26, 2.75 kg of CO2 will be obtained. If 1 kg of kerosene (C12H24) whose x/y is 0.5 is burnt, 3.14 kg of CO2 will be obtained, which represents about a 14% increase in CO2.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the CO2 emissions are greater. For example, if a gas turbine produces 20 MW of power at a thermal efficiency of 35%, the thermal input required is (20/0.35) = 57.14 MW. If methane is burnt, whose LHV is about 50 MJ/kg, a fuel flow rate of (57.14/50) 1.143 kg/s will be required and the CO2 emissions will be 3.14 kg/s. If kerosene with a LHV of about 43 MJ/kg is used, the fuel flow required is (57.14/43) = 1.329 kg/s and the CO2 emissions will be 4.17 kg/s. This represents about a 16% increase in fuel flow and a 32% increase in CO2. (It is assumed that there is no change in gas turbine performance due to the change in fuel from methane to kerosene. However, there is a slight loss in performance when burning kerosene.)\r\n\r\n# Gas turbine combustion\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n1. Hydrocarbon Fuels, Goodger, E.M., Macmillan Press (1975).\r\n",
