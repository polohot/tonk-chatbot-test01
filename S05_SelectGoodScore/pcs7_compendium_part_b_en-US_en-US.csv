# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.2 CFC settings for compiling and downloading

# Procedure

1. For compiling programs with F-blocks, set the threshold for generating the warning based on the number of blocks per sequence group. The default value is 50.

Note

This value applies for any project that is compiled on the ES and should be reset for the purpose of compiling standard programs. The warning limit is designed to prevent creation of blocks with more than 64 KB. The compiler aborts with an error in this case because blocks with more than 64 KB are not possible. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.2 CFC settings for compiling and downloading

# Procedure

1. For compiling programs with F-blocks, set the threshold for generating the warning based on the number of blocks per sequence group. The default value is 50.

Note

This value applies for any project that is compiled on the ES and should be reset for the purpose of compiling standard programs. The warning limit is designed to prevent creation of blocks with more than 64 KB. The compiler aborts with an error in this case because blocks with more than 64 KB are not possible. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.2 CFC settings for compiling and downloading

# Procedure

1. For compiling programs with F-blocks, set the threshold for generating the warning based on the number of blocks per sequence group. The default value is 50.

Note

This value applies for any project that is compiled on the ES and should be reset for the purpose of compiling standard programs. The warning limit is designed to prevent creation of blocks with more than 64 KB. The compiler aborts with an error in this case because blocks with more than 64 KB are not possible. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased. If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the required memory by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a cyclic interrupt.

# 6.1.2 Access protection with SFC 109

There is an additional mode for SFC 109 as of firmware V6.0 of the H-CPU. With MODE = 12, protection level 3 can be set without password authorization.

# Calling of SFC 109 with MODE=0

Setting the protection level: Any applicable block that is present on password authorization is lifted through this call.

# Calling of SFC 109 with MODE=1

Setting of protection level 2 with password authorization: This means that you can lift the write protection set with SFC 109 when knowing the valid password. Any applicable block that is present on password authorization is lifted through this call.

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

The user program is divided to cyclic interrupt OBs according to the requirements:

- OBA
- Very fast applications
- For example connections, such as Quadlog or Modbus
- OBB
- Fast F applications
- For example pressure protection functions
- OBC
- (Slow) F-applications
- For example slow temperature protection functions
- OBD
- Fast standard applications
- For example fast control functions
- OBE
- Slow standard applications
- For example temperature measurements, visualization functions, enable functions

The following rules apply:

- OBA to OBE:
- One of the cyclic interrupt OBs from OB30 to OB38
- Only certain cyclic interrupt OBs are available, depending on the CPU type.
- Texecution: TA &lt; TB &lt; TC &lt; TD &lt; TE
- (Texecution = The execution time of the cyclic interrupt OBs in ms configured in the CPU properties)
- OBpriority: PA &gt; PB &gt; PC &gt; PD &gt; PE
- (OBpriority = The priority of the cyclic interrupt OBs configured in the CPU properties. Possible values are 7 to 18.)

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

Using the ""Increased password security"" functionality: Projects in which the ""Increased password security"" option is activated may only continue to be used in STEP 7 V5.5 SP4 or higher, because this functionality is not backwards compatible!

Note

At least protection level 1 and ""Can be bypassed by password"" must be configured. In addition, the fail-safe program is assigned a password that is created the first time the safety-related software or hardware is used. This password must not be the same as the CPU password.

# 6.1.2 Access protection with SFC 109

There is an additional mode for SFC 109 as of firmware V6.0 of the H-CPU. With MODE = 12, protection level 3 can be set without password authorization.

# Calling of SFC 109 with MODE=0

Setting the protection level: Any applicable block that is present on password authorization is lifted through this call.

# Calling of SFC 109 with MODE=1

Setting of protection level 2 with password authorization: This means that you can lift the write protection set with SFC 109 when knowing the valid password. Any applicable block that is present on password authorization is lifted through this call.

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# Example

The following example shows how you can switch between protection level ""2"" (MODE = 1) and ""3"" (MODE = 12) of the CPU with a digital input signal (e.g. from a key switch) with SFC 109. When the system, or the safety program, starts up, protection level ""3"" is activated with a signal ""0"" at the input. With a signal ""1"", this is reduced to protection level ""2"". At this protection level, the CPU can be accessed and changes loaded into the CPU if the password is known.

# 6.1.3 Cyclic interrupts

# Parameter assignment

Process image partitions do not need to be configured for F-program parts, because F-signal modules in S7 F/FH systems are not accessed using the process image, but rather through F-module drivers. When a process image is assigned to an F-module, it must match the process image of the cyclic interrupt in which the F-module driver is processed.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

Self-test (advanced CPU test)

The CPU tests the following during the self-test:

- Processor
- Internal memory
- I/O bus

If the test detects any faults, they are reported and the CPU goes to STOP.

# Test cycle time

The test cycle time (default setting: 90 minutes) indicates the time taken for a complete background self-test.

Note

For S7 F/FH systems, this parameter can be increased up to a maximum of 12 hours (720 minutes).

In S7 F/FH systems, the test may not be modified by calling SFC 90, ""H_CTRL"". Otherwise, the safety program will go to F-STOP after a maximum of 24 hours. Switching test components on or off is prohibited.

In the event of a STOP, the self-test enters the following diagnostics event in the diagnostic buffer of the F CPU: ""Safety program: Error detected"" (event ID 16#75E1).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# CPU utilization

The cycle utilization of the system should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system.

Note

To help you determine the processing times of the individual cyclic interrupt OBs, please refer to the FAQ ""How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962)

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs and the total load of the AS can be read at the CPU_RT block.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 with PCS 7 Library V7.0, the block CPU_RT will be installed in each CPU. This block prevents a CPU STOP as a result of cycle overload, thanks to a two-stage ""load-shedding"" process:

- In the first stage of load shedding, all cyclic interrupt OBs that have not been disabled for the function by the project engineer are not processed for one cycle.
- In the second stage, none of the cyclic interrupt OBs are processed for one cycle (even the ones that were excluded previously). If this does not have a steadying effect, whenever cyclic interrupt OBs are processed their processing will be suspended again for one cycle.

Note

In order to prevent F-cycle-time monitoring in the CPU and the F-monitoring time on the F-signal modules from being triggered, and the system response time from being extended, you must disable the cyclic interrupt OBs with the F-program during the stage 1 of stop prevention.

Alternatively, you can disable stop prevention altogether by setting the parameter for input Max_RTRG of block CPU_RT to 0. You can find this block in the @CPU_RT chart.

For more information on the subject of CPU stop prevention, please refer to the help section for the CPU_RT block.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.1 Adapting CPU parameters (single F-system)

# 6.1.4 Diagnostics/Clock

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external clock (SICLOCK) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this time master and, therefore, identical time.

You can find additional information about configuring the time synchronization in the manual ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

Check that the correction factor is set to 0 ms under ""Time"" on the ""Diagnostics/Clock"" tab in a CPU with safety program.

Troubleshooting

TROUBLESHOOTING mode is set by default in response to a comparison error (default response). The purpose of troubleshooting is to locate a faulty CPU.

Select how the H system should react to an error generated during the comparison of the RAM areas and the process images of the outputs:

- Troubleshooting: TROUBLESHOOTING mode can only be reached from the ""Redundant"" system state. If an error occurs in redundant mode and depending on the error, one of the CPUs goes into TROUBLESHOOTING mode and performs a full self-test. The other CPU becomes the master. If a hardware error is detected, the CPU goes to DEFECTIVE mode. If no error is detected, the CPU is coupled again. The H system goes back into the ""Redundant"" system state. This is followed by an automatic master-standby switchover. This ensures that when the next error is detected in troubleshooting mode, the hardware of the previous master CPU is tested.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

All settings made in the single F-system must also be made in the fault-tolerant F-system.

Note

Parameters in blue can be changed during operation on an H system.

The following settings must also be made when using redundant CPUs:

- Reaction to RAM/PIQ comparison error
- Cyclic interrupt OB with special handling
- Monitoring times

# 6.2.1 Reaction to RAM/PIQ comparison error

Troubleshooting

TROUBLESHOOTING mode is set by default in response to a comparison error (default response). The purpose of troubleshooting is to locate a faulty CPU.

Select how the H system should react to an error generated during the comparison of the RAM areas and the process images of the outputs:

- Troubleshooting: TROUBLESHOOTING mode can only be reached from the ""Redundant"" system state. If an error occurs in redundant mode and depending on the error, one of the CPUs goes into TROUBLESHOOTING mode and performs a full self-test. The other CPU becomes the master. If a hardware error is detected, the CPU goes to DEFECTIVE mode. If no error is detected, the CPU is coupled again. The H system goes back into the ""Redundant"" system state. This is followed by an automatic master-standby switchover. This ensures that when the next error is detected in troubleshooting mode, the hardware of the previous master CPU is tested.

Note

The events that trigger TROUBLESHOOTING mode are described in the following manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/82478488)""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748473)""

Priority class

In order to prevent time monitoring (F-CYC_CO or the monitoring time of modules) from being triggered in the event of a CPU that is starting up in the H system being coupled/updated, you need to set the priority of the cyclic interrupt OBs allocated to the F-program (OB 30 to OB 38) to &gt; 15 on the ""Cyclic Interrupts"" tab (see Monitoring times).

""Cyclic interrupt OB with special handling"" is an H parameter containing the number of the cyclic interrupt OB which is called specifically by the operating system when the standby CPU is updated, once all interrupts have been disabled.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Maximum disabling time for priority classes

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

Note

# 6.3 Communications module parameters/Networks

The settings for communication modules are explained in Compendium Part A. It may be advisable to operate the F-I/O on a separate DP master system when there are numerous nodes or nodes with low transmission speeds.

# PROFINET

PROFINET with PROFINET IO is increasingly used in automation engineering. PROFINET IO is the open standard defined according to the PROFINET standard for communication between controller and I/O devices based on Switched Ethernet. The PROFIsafe specification has been expanded for fail-safe communication between controller and PROFINET IOs, and is used in version PROFIsafe V2.x with PROFINET. You can find additional information about PROFINET IO in the entry ""PROFINET in Process Automation with SIMATIC PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082).

# Requirements for using PROFINET with S7 F Systems

PROFIsafe version V2, which is required for fail-safe communication via PROFINET, is available in S7 F Systems as of V6.0. The following components are required to use PROFINET with S7 F Systems:

# Recommended software requirements:

- PCS 7 V8.0 SP2 or higher
- S7 F Systems V6.1 SP1 or higher
- As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3
- S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP11 or higher

# Hardware requirements:

- CPU (CPU 412-5H, CPU 414-5H, CPU 416-5H, CPU 417-5H or CPU 410, CPU 410E)
- I/O modules:
- SM 326F, DI 24xDC24V (6ES7 326-1BK02-0AB0)
- SM 326F, DO 10xDC24V/2A, P-switching (6ES7 326-2BF10-0AB0)
- SM 326F, DO 8xDC24V/2A, P-M-switching (6ES7 326-2BF41-0AB0)
- SM 336F, AI 6x0/4...20mA HART (6ES7 336-4GE00-0AB0)

Note: Before you use the fail-safe devices make sure that they support PROFIsafe V2 mode (F_Par_Version = 1) on PROFINET IO as well as in the downstream networks (PROFINET IO or PROFIBUS DP). The set PROFIsafe mode of the device is documented in the hardware printout.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

# 6.4.2 PROFIsafe addresses

F source and destination addresses

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

Maximum disabling time for priority classes

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times for the cyclic interrupt OBs may also be read at the CPU_RT block.

Work memory allocation (data memory)

The work memory allocation comprises all data blocks; in other words, it also includes DBs generated dynamically. A value of 1024 KB is entered here by default. This value should be modified to reflect the actual data memory requirements of the user program. We recommend adding an expansion reserve of approximately 10%.

The allocation of work memory for data blocks can be read in SIMATIC Manager by selecting the block container with the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"".

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times for the cyclic interrupt OBs may also be read at the CPU_RT block.

Work memory allocation (data memory)

The work memory allocation comprises all data blocks; in other words, it also includes DBs generated dynamically. A value of 1024 KB is entered here by default. This value should be modified to reflect the actual data memory requirements of the user program. We recommend adding an expansion reserve of approximately 10%.

The allocation of work memory for data blocks can be read in SIMATIC Manager by selecting the block container with the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"".

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

Safety mode

""Safety mode"" is to be set for the signal modules.

# 6.4.2 PROFIsafe addresses

F source and destination addresses

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

# 6.4.1 Operating mode

Safety mode

""Safety mode"" is to be set for the signal modules.

# 6.4.2 PROFIsafe addresses

F source and destination addresses

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Similar to standard modules, F-signal modules are configured in HW Config. This requires the corresponding S7 F Configuration Pack.

Unused channels can be added during operation, provided that, during first commissioning, they have been activated in HW Config and equipped with resistors in order to suppress channel faults.

# Procedure

Once you have added the F-signal modules to the ET 200M station in HW Config, you can access the ""Properties"" dialog by selecting the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"" or double-clicking the corresponding F-signal module.

The PROFIsafe addresses (F_SOURCE_ADD, F_DEST_ADD) are used to uniquely identify the source and destination during PROFIsafe communication. The F_DEST_ADD uniquely identifies the PROFIsafe destination (the module). The F_DEST_ADD must, therefore, be unique across both the network and the station. The F_SOURCE_ADD is permanently assigned to the CPU.

To prevent parameter assignment errors, the F_SOURCE_ADD and the F_DEST_ADD are assigned automatically.

You can use this dialog to calculate monitoring times for updating the standby CPU. You need to enter information about your user program for this purpose:

- Runtime of cyclic interrupt OB with special handling
- Work memory used for all data blocks in the user program

Defaults from the process (monitoring times) and the current configuration (bus parameters, number and type of DP slaves, etc.) are also used in the calculation.

Run time of the cyclic interrupt concerned

If a cyclic interrupt OB with special handling has already been configured, half its execution interval will be entered as the default setting for ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned"". Here, enter the actual runtime of the cyclic interrupt with special handling, plus some reserve time (10 to 20%).

Note

The runtime can be calculated using the TIME_BEG and TIME_END blocks. You can find information on this in the ""How do I set the runtime and time scale of a cyclic interrupt OB?"" FAQ.

As of PCS 7 V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the run times for the cyclic interrupt OBs may also be read at the CPU_RT block.

Work memory allocation (data memory)

The work memory allocation comprises all data blocks; in other words, it also includes DBs generated dynamically. A value of 1024 KB is entered here by default. This value should be modified to reflect the actual data memory requirements of the user program. We recommend adding an expansion reserve of approximately 10%.

The allocation of work memory for data blocks can be read in SIMATIC Manager by selecting the block container with the menu command ""Edit > Object Properties"".

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

# Calculation

Once all the parameters have been set, the values are calculated by pressing the ""Recalculate"" button.

If the F-signal modules are configured in safety mode in HW Config, the ""Max. disabling time for priority classes > 15"" parameter is calculated using the following formula:

- TP15 (DP master system) = TPTO - (2 x TTR + TCI + TPROG + TDP_ST + TSLAVE_ST) (determined for each DP master system)
- TP15_UP in ms = 0.7 x size of DBs in work memory in bytes/1024 + 75

where:

- TPTO = Shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module
- TTR = Target rotation time of the PROFIBUS line
- TCI = Call time of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TPROG = Runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_ST = DP switchover time
- TSLAVE_ST = Slave switchover time
- TP15_UP = Time for copying the DBs of the user program (UP)

Calculating the parameters may cause one of the following messages to appear:

- ""The F-monitoring times cannot be adhered to due to the configuration specified. Times which can no longer be used were output."" if: ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" < ""Minimum I/O retention time"" + 50 ms
- ""Due to the configuration specified, monitoring times have been calculated to ensure that the F-monitoring time can be adhered to. It cannot be guaranteed that each attempt at coupling and updating will be successful."" if: TP15 (DP master system) < TP15_UP

The ""Maximum communication delay"" and ""Maximum scan cycle time extension"" are calculated from the ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" by multiplying this setting once by 4 and once by 10.

Note

When determining the shortest F-monitoring time configured on an F-signal module, none of the monitoring times set in PROFIsafe PA devices are taken into account.

# 6.2 Adapting CPU parameters (fault-tolerant F system)

Maximum disabling time for priority classes

Check the value for ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"".

Note

We recommend doing this again on the plant once commissioning is complete.

Follow the steps outlined below:

- Start up the standby CPU in an H-system. Observe the FAQ ""What do I have to keep in mind when downloading changes of an H-system with safety program?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/89330232).
- In the diagnostic buffer of the master CPU, search for messages relating to the master CPU's ""Transition from coupling to updating"", as well as for the message ""Redundant mode"".
- The ""Maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15"" must be greater than the time difference between the two messages. Make sure you factor reserve time of approximately 20% into your setting.

Note

# 6.3 Communications module parameters/Networks

The settings for communication modules are explained in Compendium Part A. It may be advisable to operate the F-I/O on a separate DP master system when there are numerous nodes or nodes with low transmission speeds.

# PROFINET

PROFINET with PROFINET IO is increasingly used in automation engineering. PROFINET IO is the open standard defined according to the PROFINET standard for communication between controller and I/O devices based on Switched Ethernet. The PROFIsafe specification has been expanded for fail-safe communication between controller and PROFINET IOs, and is used in version PROFIsafe V2.x with PROFINET. You can find additional information about PROFINET IO in the entry ""PROFINET in Process Automation with SIMATIC PCS 7"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082).

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

For the following F signal modules, group diagnostics needs to be activated whenever a channel is activated:

- SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR (order no. 6ES7326-1RF00-0AB0; 6ES7326-1RF01-0AB0)

- SM 326; AI 6 x 13 Bit (order no. 6ES7336-1HE00-0AB0)

With all other F signal modules, this takes place automatically when you activate a channel. To maintain an overview, you should deactivate group diagnostics on input or output channels which are not in use on the F signal modules or wire the module so that no channel errors occur.

Note
Where fail-safe input and output modules in safety mode are concerned, group diagnostics must be active on all connected channels. Please check that group diagnostics has only been deactivated for input and output channels which are not in use.

# 6.4.4 Activating channels

With fail-safe signal modules, it is not possible to make and download changes in runtime due to their design. You can find additional information about changes in HW Config in the section Changes in HW Config (Page 179).

In order to be able to use free channels on F signal modules for expansion during operation, the channels in the HW Config must be enabled and configured accordingly beforehand. Configure the channels differently in order to be able to connect different sensor types. Due to the diagnostics for the F-signal modules, however, activated channels lead to pending errors, which you can suppress by equipping the channels with equivalent resistors.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs on a F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

Group diagnostics

If you check this box for a specific channel, a channel-specific event (a wire break, for example) will trigger an error reaction in the safety program (the substitute value is activated on the channel driver and QBAD is set). If ""Enable diagnostics interrupt"" is selected, a diagnostics interrupt will be triggered in the CPU and a corresponding process control message will be sent on the OS. The ""Group diagnostics"" parameter is used to activate and deactivate the transfer of channel-specific diagnostic messages (e.g. wire break, short circuit) on F signal modules to the CPU.

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

For the following F signal modules, group diagnostics needs to be activated whenever a channel is activated:

- SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR (order no. 6ES7326-1RF00-0AB0; 6ES7326-1RF01-0AB0)
- SM 326; DI 24 x DC 24 V (order no. 6ES7326-1BK00-0AB0)

- SM 326; AI 6 x 13 Bit (order no. 6ES7336-1HE00-0AB0)

With all other F signal modules, this takes place automatically when you activate a channel. To maintain an overview, you should deactivate group diagnostics on input or output channels which are not in use on the F signal modules or wire the module so that no channel errors occur.

Note
Where fail-safe input and output modules in safety mode are concerned, group diagnostics must be active on all connected channels. Please check that group diagnostics has only been deactivated for input and output channels which are not in use.

# 6.4.4 Activating channels

With fail-safe signal modules, it is not possible to make and download changes in runtime due to their design. You can find additional information about changes in HW Config in the section Changes in HW Config (Page 179).

In order to be able to use free channels on F signal modules for expansion during operation, the channels in the HW Config must be enabled and configured accordingly beforehand. Configure the channels differently in order to be able to connect different sensor types. Due to the diagnostics for the F-signal modules, however, activated channels lead to pending errors, which you can suppress by equipping the channels with equivalent resistors.

Group diagnostics

If you check this box for a specific channel, a channel-specific event (a wire break, for example) will trigger an error reaction in the safety program (the substitute value is activated on the channel driver and QBAD is set). If ""Enable diagnostics interrupt"" is selected, a diagnostics interrupt will be triggered in the CPU and a corresponding process control message will be sent on the OS. The ""Group diagnostics"" parameter is used to activate and deactivate the transfer of channel-specific diagnostic messages (e.g. wire break, short circuit) on F signal modules to the CPU.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

For the following F signal modules, group diagnostics needs to be activated whenever a channel is activated:

- SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR (order no. 6ES7326-1RF00-0AB0; 6ES7326-1RF01-0AB0)
- SM 326; DI 24 x DC 24 V (order no. 6ES7326-1BK00-0AB0)
- SM 336; DO 10 x DC 24V/2A (order no. 6ES7326-2BF00-0AB0)
- SM 326; AI 6 x 13 Bit (order no. 6ES7336-1HE00-0AB0)

With all other F signal modules, this takes place automatically when you activate a channel. To maintain an overview, you should deactivate group diagnostics on input or output channels which are not in use on the F signal modules or wire the module so that no channel errors occur.

Note
Where fail-safe input and output modules in safety mode are concerned, group diagnostics must be active on all connected channels. Please check that group diagnostics has only been deactivated for input and output channels which are not in use.

# 6.4.4 Activating channels

With fail-safe signal modules, it is not possible to make and download changes in runtime due to their design. You can find additional information about changes in HW Config in the section Changes in HW Config (Page 179).

In order to be able to use free channels on F signal modules for expansion during operation, the channels in the HW Config must be enabled and configured accordingly beforehand. Configure the channels differently in order to be able to connect different sensor types. Due to the diagnostics for the F-signal modules, however, activated channels lead to pending errors, which you can suppress by equipping the channels with equivalent resistors.

With all other F signal modules, this takes place automatically when you activate a channel. To maintain an overview, you should deactivate group diagnostics on input or output channels which are not in use on the F signal modules or wire the module so that no channel errors occur.

Note
Where fail-safe input and output modules in safety mode are concerned, group diagnostics must be active on all connected channels. Please check that group diagnostics has only been deactivated for input and output channels which are not in use.

# 6.4.4 Activating channels

With fail-safe signal modules, it is not possible to make and download changes in runtime due to their design. You can find additional information about changes in HW Config in the section Changes in HW Config (Page 179).

In order to be able to use free channels on F signal modules for expansion during operation, the channels in the HW Config must be enabled and configured accordingly beforehand. Configure the channels differently in order to be able to connect different sensor types. Due to the diagnostics for the F-signal modules, however, activated channels lead to pending errors, which you can suppress by equipping the channels with equivalent resistors.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs on a F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

Group diagnostics

If you check this box for a specific channel, a channel-specific event (a wire break, for example) will trigger an error reaction in the safety program (the substitute value is activated on the channel driver and QBAD is set). If ""Enable diagnostics interrupt"" is selected, a diagnostics interrupt will be triggered in the CPU and a corresponding process control message will be sent on the OS. The ""Group diagnostics"" parameter is used to activate and deactivate the transfer of channel-specific diagnostic messages (e.g. wire break, short circuit) on F signal modules to the CPU.

# Sensor supply via module

You can set whether the sensor is supplied via the F signal module using these parameters. Additionally, you can also activate a short-circuit test for the supply through the F signal module.

Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# Short-circuit test

You can use this parameter to activate short-circuit detection for the F signal module. The short-circuit test can only be activated for sensors that are supplied by the F signal module. Short-circuit detection disconnects the sensor supply briefly and tests the input signal. In so doing, a cross circuit is detected between the channels and an ""L+"" fault at the active inputs. Whenever a short-circuit is detected, the F signal module will trigger a diagnostics interrupt on the CPU and send a corresponding process control message to the OS.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel.
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs of an F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels, SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

# Type of sensor interconnection

If ""1oo2 sensor evaluation"" is selected, you can select the type of sensor interconnection for each input channel (exception: SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR, for which this parameter does not exist. For this module, only 2-channel equivalent sensor interconnection can generally be selected where ""1oo2 evaluation"" is concerned.):

- ""2-channel equivalent""
A two-channel sensor or two single-channel sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""2-channel non-equivalent""
One non-equivalent sensor or two single-channel, non-equivalent sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""1-channel""
A sensor (1-channel) is connected to two opposite inputs.

Note
If you are using the ""2-channel non-equivalent"" or ""1-channel"" type of sensor interconnection, and the internal sensor supply and the short-circuit test are parameterized, the Vss supply voltage from the left-hand side of the F signal module must be used.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# Short-circuit test

You can use this parameter to activate short-circuit detection for the F signal module. The short-circuit test can only be activated for sensors that are supplied by the F signal module. Short-circuit detection disconnects the sensor supply briefly and tests the input signal. In so doing, a cross circuit is detected between the channels and an ""L+"" fault at the active inputs. Whenever a short-circuit is detected, the F signal module will trigger a diagnostics interrupt on the CPU and send a corresponding process control message to the OS.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel.
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs of an F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels, SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

# Type of sensor interconnection

If ""1oo2 sensor evaluation"" is selected, you can select the type of sensor interconnection for each input channel (exception: SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR, for which this parameter does not exist. For this module, only 2-channel equivalent sensor interconnection can generally be selected where ""1oo2 evaluation"" is concerned.):

- ""2-channel equivalent""
A two-channel sensor or two single-channel sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""2-channel non-equivalent""
One non-equivalent sensor or two single-channel, non-equivalent sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""1-channel""
A sensor (1-channel) is connected to two opposite inputs.

Note
If you are using the ""2-channel non-equivalent"" or ""1-channel"" type of sensor interconnection, and the internal sensor supply and the short-circuit test are parameterized, the Vss supply voltage from the left-hand side of the F signal module must be used.

# Sensor supply via module

You can set whether the sensor is supplied via the F signal module using these parameters. Additionally, you can also activate a short-circuit test for the supply through the F signal module.

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# Short-circuit test

You can use this parameter to activate short-circuit detection for the F signal module. The short-circuit test can only be activated for sensors that are supplied by the F signal module. Short-circuit detection disconnects the sensor supply briefly and tests the input signal. In so doing, a cross circuit is detected between the channels and an ""L+"" fault at the active inputs. Whenever a short-circuit is detected, the F signal module will trigger a diagnostics interrupt on the CPU and send a corresponding process control message to the OS.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 (1v1) evaluation
A sensor connected to the F signal module via a single channel.
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation
For a process signal one or two sensors are connected to two opposite inputs of an F signal module. The signal states of inputs (equivalence or non-equivalence) are compared internally.

The following safety classes can be achieved:

- 1-channel – SIL 2; in the case of multiple channels, SIL 3 can be achieved by means of voting in the CPU.
- 2-channel – SIL 3 (voting on module)

# Type of sensor interconnection

If ""1oo2 sensor evaluation"" is selected, you can select the type of sensor interconnection for each input channel (exception: SM 326; DI 8 x NAMUR, for which this parameter does not exist. For this module, only 2-channel equivalent sensor interconnection can generally be selected where ""1oo2 evaluation"" is concerned.):

- ""2-channel equivalent""
A two-channel sensor or two single-channel sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""2-channel non-equivalent""
One non-equivalent sensor or two single-channel, non-equivalent sensors (2-channel connection) is/are connected to two opposite input channels.
- ""1-channel""
A sensor (1-channel) is connected to two opposite inputs.

Note
If you are using the ""2-channel non-equivalent"" or ""1-channel"" type of sensor interconnection, and the internal sensor supply and the short-circuit test are parameterized, the Vss supply voltage from the left-hand side of the F signal module must be used.

Deactivating the light test

For the purpose of the test, 1-signals are connected to the output while the output is inactive (output signal ""0""). This setting activates the output briefly (&lt; 1 ms) (= ""light period""). The dark test, which the module performs cyclically, is sufficient for SIL 2. This involves connecting 0 signals to the output while it is active. The output is deactivated briefly (&lt; 1 ms) (""dark period"") in order to detect short circuits. In order to detect cross circuits between outputs, during the dark test various bit patterns are issued one after the other to a group of outputs (first the left half of the module, then the right half). For SIL 3, the light test also needs to be performed or the output switched at least once a day.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

# Type of sensor interconnection (analog inputs)

When safety mode is activated 1 or 2 sensors can be configured per input channel. Discrepancy handling can be set accordingly.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

The module conducts complete bit pattern tests within the configured maximum test time. If the output is active in the ""good condition"", a dark test is always conducted. If the output is not active in the ""good condition"", activate the light test with this parameter. If the signal changes daily or more often, SIL3/Kat.4/PLe can be achieved even without a light test. If this is not reached with a ""0"" signal, the light test must be activated which then fulfills this condition.

# Maximum light test time

With the parameter ""maximum test time(s)"", you determine the time within which the light and dark tests are to be conducted (in all combinations) for the whole module. After this time elapses the tests are repeated.

Light periods arise during the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is inactive (""0"" output signal). This then activates the output briefly (= ""light period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains deactivated.

Each output channel has its own configurable maximum light test time. The maximum light test time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum light test time is set too low for a controlled capacitive load, the output channel is passivated because charging does not occur within the configured time.

In the event of faulty readback signals, the light test signal is available for the parameterized maximum light test time at the output before the error ""Short circuit to M"" leads to the passivation of the output channel.

# Set maximum light test time:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the maximum light test time to the maximum value of 5 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault reaction time is extended by the configured maximum light test time, the light test time should be set as low as possible by trial and error (however, high enough to avoid passivating the output channel).
3. If you have set a maximum light test time in a way that results in the output channel being passivated sporadically, set the next higher value of the maximum light time.

Maximum dark test readback time

Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal). This deactivates the output briefly (= ""dark period""). A sufficiently inactive actuator does not respond to this and remains activated. Each output channel has its own configurable maximum readback time for the dark test.

The maximum readback time should be set sufficiently high if the affected channel switches high capacitive loads. If the maximum readback time is set too low for a connected capacitive load, the output channel is passivated, since discharge does not occur within the configured time.

Configure these parameters so that the module reads back correctly and your actuator still does not react to the switch-off pulse.

Set readback times:

1. If an output channel is continuously being passivated with an intact F-SM, this can be in contact with a capacitive component of the controlled load that is too large. In such an instance, configure the readback time to the maximum value of 400 ms. If passivation of the channel continues to occur, either an external fault is present or the connected capacity lies outside of the permitted range.
2. Since the fault response time is extended by the readback time, the readback time should be set as short as possible when testing (but long enough so the output channel is not passivated).
3. If you have set a readback time in a way that results in the output channel being sporadically passivated, set the next higher value for the maximum readback time dark test. Dark periods arise during deactivation tests and the complete bit pattern test. In this process, a test signal is connected to the output from the fail-safe output module while the output is active (""1"" output signal).

Redundant interconnection

With this parameter you set whether this channel is operated redundantly.

Note

If you do not activate this channel with a redundant interconnection the ""Short circuit of output to L+ or output driver defect"" diagnosis is reported.

The measurement type depends on the operating mode selected. The operating mode can be selected for each channel. In safety mode the following measurement types are available:

- ""2DMU"" or ""4DMU"" for current measurements. (4 to 20mA)
- ""Deactivated"": The channel is not processed by the module.

# Measuring range

The selection options in the measuring range field vary depending on the selected mode (safety mode activated or deactivated) as well as the measurement type. If a channel is deactivated, it will not be possible to select a measuring range.

Note
If you are using Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs), you should select 4DMU for the configuration, since the supply is provided via the MTAs.

Note
In safety mode, only the 4 to 20 mA measuring range is permitted. In this measuring range, a current of < 3.6 mA will produce a wire-break signal. If, however, the type of sensor you are using (e.g. a gas sensor) means that you do need to process signals that fall below this range, you can deactivate F wire-break detection. In this case, a current of < 1.18 mA will produce an underflow message.

In the processing industry, no evaluation is generally performed between 2 signals on the module. 1oo1 is set for sensor evaluation. This makes all the signals available in the user program, where they can be linked in 1oo2 or 2oo3, depending on what is required. If 1oo2 evaluation is to be implemented on the module, you can find the parameter description for discrepancy handling in the online help.

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.4 Setting system parameters for F-signal modules

# HART gate

This enables HART communication with the transducers to be controlled. ON/OFF switches HART communication on or off for the entire module, in a safety-related manner. If ""Can be switched"" is set here, HART communication may be enabled or disabled on the F-channel driver.

# Interference frequency suppression

Setting interference frequency suppression for the line frequency. The corresponding integration time of the analog digital converter is displayed. If you change this setting, the increment for the F-monitoring time and for the discrepancy times will also change automatically. The values set there will be adjusted to the next lowest value.

# Sensor evaluation

- 1oo1 evaluation: Each channel is considered individually and the input value forwarded to the CPU.
- 1oo2 evaluation: 2 channels are combined in all cases (0/3, 1/4, and 2/5). A discrepancy analysis is performed on the module and the configured input value is forwarded to the CPU.

# Reintegration following a discrepancy error

You use this parameter to determine when a discrepancy error is considered lifted and, therefore, when a reintegration of the affected input channels is possible. You can choose between the following parameter options:

- ""Test 0 signal necessary""
If you have configured ""Test 0 signal necessary"", a discrepancy error is only considered lifted once a 0 signal is present at both input channels concerned. ",What options are available for reintegration following a discrepancy error in the F-signal modules?,A4,"The parameter 'Test 0 signal necessary' ensures reintegration only after both channels show a 0 signal, resolving the discrepancy.",1.90625,1.9375,3.578125,1.3046875,0.453125,1.9539062499999997,Y

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

# Procedure

1. In HW Config, configure both F signal modules in the ET 200M stations.
2. Configure the first F signal module:
- Activate ""Safety mode"" in the ""Parameters"" tab.
3. Configure the second F signal module:
- Activate ""Safety mode"" in the ""Parameters"" tab.
4. For the second F signal module, select ""2 modules"" mode in the ""Redundancy"" tab.
5. In the ""Find redundant module"" dialog for the F signal module, select the redundant F signal module.
6. Set further parameters as necessary. The settings are applied automatically for the redundant F signal module. As soon as two F signal modules are redundant, changes to the parameter settings for one of them will automatically be applied for the other.
7. Check the default discrepancy time for redundant, fail-safe digital input modules.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

You can use the fail-safe signal modules S7-300 (F signal modules) – with the exception of the F-DO 8 x DC 24V/2A PM – redundantly in one or several different ET 200Ms. Where F signal modules configured with redundancy are concerned, please note the following:

- The two F signal modules are of the same FW and HW product versions.
- ""Safety mode"" is set for both F signal modules.

Where fail-safe signal input modules configured with redundancy are concerned, it is possible to draw a distinction between two application cases:

- One sensor: The sensor is wired to both redundant F signal modules.
- Two sensors: One sensor is wired to each of the redundant F signal modules (module and sensor are redundant).

For redundant fail-safe digital input modules, the F channel driver F_CH_DI can perform a discrepancy analysis to increase availability using the S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2. You need to set the ""Discrepancy time"" parameter in the hardware configuration for this purpose. Set a discrepancy time of ""0"" to deactivate the discrepancy analysis.

The F channel driver F_CH_DI provides the result of the discrepancy analysis at output DISCF or DISCF_R. The signals must either be further processed in the logic or signaled with a signal module.

F_CH_AI does not perform a discrepancy analysis prior to S7 F Systems Lib 1_3 SP1 Upd1. If you have wired one sensor to both F signal modules, Zener diodes are required so that the electrical circuit is not interrupted when a redundant module is pulled. If you require a discrepancy analysis for the purpose of monitoring Zener diodes, select the same procedure as for two sensors.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, F_CH_AI can also perform a discrepancy analysis. The function must be enabled at the DISC_ON input and discrepancy time (DISC_TIM) and deviation (DELTA) must be configured at the corresponding inputs. As with F_CH_DI, the discrepancy error output (DISCF) must be connected to a message block in order to signal the error.

If you are using two sensors, then both signals should also be available in the user program. In this case, it is not possible to use the redundancy function of the F-AI module. Read both signals in and use block F_1oo2AI for signal selection and discrepancy analysis purposes.

# Configuring S7F/FH hardware

# 6.5 Configuring redundant F-signal modules

# Procedure

1. In HW Config, configure both F signal modules in the ET 200M stations.
2. Configure the first F signal module:
- Activate ""Safety mode"" in the ""Parameters"" tab.
3. Configure the second F signal module:
- Activate ""Safety mode"" in the ""Parameters"" tab.
4. For the second F signal module, select ""2 modules"" mode in the ""Redundancy"" tab.
5. In the ""Find redundant module"" dialog for the F signal module, select the redundant F signal module.
6. Set further parameters as necessary. The settings are applied automatically for the redundant F signal module. As soon as two F signal modules are redundant, changes to the parameter settings for one of them will automatically be applied for the other.
7. Check the default discrepancy time for redundant, fail-safe digital input modules.

# 6.6 Marshalled Termination Assemblies (MTAs)

The MTA Terminal Modules enable you to connect field devices, sensors, and actuators quickly and easily to the F signal modules of the ET 200M distributed I/O. MTAs are available for standard and F signal modules.

Pre-assembled cables are used to wire the MTAs to the singular or redundant ET 200M modules. MTAs can be used to significantly reduce the time and money spent on cabling and commissioning; they also help to avoid wiring errors.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.1 Introduction

As well as functions for programming safety functions, the F-blocks contain functions for detecting and reacting to errors. In other words, they ensure that failures and errors are detected and that an appropriate reaction is triggered to maintain the F-system in or switch it to a safe state. ",Where can additional information on configuring redundant I/O modules be found?,A2,"Additional details are available in the PCS 7 Compendium Part A, specifically in the Configuration Guidelines.",2.671875,3.015625,3.8125,1.2734375,0.44140625,2.5519531250000003,Y

The user program in the CPU can be created from F-and non-F blocks. The F-program is configured in separate runtime groups.

Data transfer between the standard program and the F-program is handled using conversion blocks. Please note that safety functions must be implemented with F-blocks consistently from the input driver to the output driver. Standard signals may only change the state of a safe output if the safety function is in a healthy state.

During compilation, specific functions for detecting and reacting to errors are automatically added to the F-program. The S7 F-System optional package also features functions for comparing F-programs and providing support for the acceptance and approval procedure for F-programs, such as functions for generating a signature via the F-program which can be used to detect changes to functions and parameters. This signature is saved during the plant acceptance procedure.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.1 Defining the program structure

In addition to considering the standard scenario, you need to answer the following questions when drafting a safety program:

- Which parts of the user program need to be fail-safe?
- Which response times do you need to achieve?

You will need to split your F-program into various cyclic interrupt OBs (OB 30 to OB 38) in accordance with these requirements.

You will improve performance if you program parts of the program which are not needed for the safety functions in the standard user program.

In terms of dividing your program between the standard user program and the safety program, please remember that the standard user program is easier to change and download to the F-CPU. Changes to the standard user program do not usually need to undergo acceptance and approval.

# Rules governing program structure

When drafting a safety program for S7 F/FH Systems, you need to observe the following rules:

- F-runtime groups with F-blocks can only be assigned to cyclic interrupts OB 30 to OB 38.
- A chart can contain both F-blocks and standard blocks; they need to be inserted in separate runtime groups in this case. You are not permitted to use these charts as F-block types.
- In the safety program, access to the F-signal modules is only permitted via the F-channel driver (F_CH_xx).

# Inserting F blocks

Blocks are inserted into the chart from the library ""S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2 > F User Blocks"" using drag-and-drop. There is no limit on the number of times a block can be dragged and dropped.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.1 Defining the program structure

In addition to considering the standard scenario, you need to answer the following questions when drafting a safety program:

- Which parts of the user program need to be fail-safe?
- Which response times do you need to achieve?

You will need to split your F-program into various cyclic interrupt OBs (OB 30 to OB 38) in accordance with these requirements.

You will improve performance if you program parts of the program which are not needed for the safety functions in the standard user program.

In terms of dividing your program between the standard user program and the safety program, please remember that the standard user program is easier to change and download to the F-CPU. Changes to the standard user program do not usually need to undergo acceptance and approval.

# Rules governing program structure

When drafting a safety program for S7 F/FH Systems, you need to observe the following rules:

- F-runtime groups with F-blocks can only be assigned to cyclic interrupts OB 30 to OB 38.
- A chart can contain both F-blocks and standard blocks; they need to be inserted in separate runtime groups in this case. You are not permitted to use these charts as F-block types.
- In the safety program, access to the F-signal modules is only permitted via the F-channel driver (F_CH_xx).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.1 Defining the program structure

In addition to considering the standard scenario, you need to answer the following questions when drafting a safety program:

- Which parts of the user program need to be fail-safe?
- Which response times do you need to achieve?

You will need to split your F-program into various cyclic interrupt OBs (OB 30 to OB 38) in accordance with these requirements.

You will improve performance if you program parts of the program which are not needed for the safety functions in the standard user program.

In terms of dividing your program between the standard user program and the safety program, please remember that the standard user program is easier to change and download to the F-CPU. Changes to the standard user program do not usually need to undergo acceptance and approval.

# Rules governing program structure

When drafting a safety program for S7 F/FH Systems, you need to observe the following rules:

- F-runtime groups with F-blocks can only be assigned to cyclic interrupts OB 30 to OB 38.
- A chart can contain both F-blocks and standard blocks; they need to be inserted in separate runtime groups in this case. You are not permitted to use these charts as F-block types.
- In the safety program, access to the F-signal modules is only permitted via the F-channel driver (F_CH_xx).

- F module driver for F-signal modules with outputs or with inputs and outputs
- F-communications blocks and F-system blocks for sending
- F block F_PLK_O
- F block F_DIAG (S7 F-Systems Lib V1_3 and higher)

The run sequence of the blocks listed under items 1 and 5 is adjusted automatically when the F-program is compiled.
As if S7 F Systems Lib V1_3, separate runtime groups are created for the F blocks listed under points 1 and 5 during the first compilation.
The IPO principle (input, process, output) must always be observed when placing F-channel drivers and F-blocks for user logic.
This ensures that all inputs are read first, the relevant processing steps are performed, and all outputs are then written.
Furthermore, F-runtime groups and F-monitoring blocks that are only visible following compilation are also added automatically.

Note

No changes may be made in the automatically added runtime groups with the exception of the scan cycle monitoring on ""F_CYC_CO"" blocks and the parameter assignment of the ""F_SHUTDN"" block.

@F_DbInitxx DB_INIT function block required for the cold restart of an F-runtime group

All required error OBs are added to the block container in the SIMATIC Manager.

There should only be one @F_IN_xx_y runtime group before the first F-user runtime group and one @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group after the last F-user runtime group. If the safety program consists of several shutdown groups (see section 6.2.6 (Page 87)), there is the @F_IN_xx_y and @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group both before and after the F-user runtime group in the shutdown groups.

# Rules for F-runtime groups in the safety program

- We recommend that you proceed as follows in order to make the lengths of the F-cycles as uniform as possible:
If you mix F-and standard runtime groups in a cyclic interrupt OB, you must execute the F-runtime groups before the standard runtime groups.
- The following defaults are set for properties of an F-runtime group:
- Reduction ratio = 1
- Phase offset = 0
- Properties Runtime Group
- Task: 0B37
- Name: HS104
- Comment:
- Reduction ratio:
- Phase offset:
- Optimize run sequence
- Active:
- You are not permitted to move automatically generated F-runtime groups (identified by @).

Note: The feature: Optimize Run Sequence in CFC can lead to a change in the collective signature and impair the response times of the safety program, and therefore should not be used in F-runtime groups.

With PCS 7 V7.0 SP1 and higher, it is no longer possible to optimize the run sequence for cyclic interrupt OBs with F-runtime groups.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.6 F-shutdown groups

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

Converting F-data types to standard data types

If you need the standard user program to process data from the F-program further (for monitoring on the PCS 7 OS, for example), a block for F_FDatatype_Datatype data conversion will have to be interconnected in the user program so that the F-data types can be converted into standard data types. This converter blocks must be called in the standard user program (standard runtime group).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

This ensures that all inputs are read first, the relevant processing steps are performed, and all outputs are then written.
Furthermore, F-runtime groups and F-monitoring blocks that are only visible following compilation are also added automatically.

@F_DbInitxx DB_INIT function block required for the cold restart of an F-runtime group

All required error OBs are added to the block container in the SIMATIC Manager.

There should only be one @F_IN_xx_y runtime group before the first F-user runtime group and one @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group after the last F-user runtime group. If the safety program consists of several shutdown groups (see section 6.2.6 (Page 87)), there is the @F_IN_xx_y and @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group both before and after the F-user runtime group in the shutdown groups.

# Rules for F-runtime groups in the safety program

- We recommend that you proceed as follows in order to make the lengths of the F-cycles as uniform as possible:
If you mix F-and standard runtime groups in a cyclic interrupt OB, you must execute the F-runtime groups before the standard runtime groups.
- The following defaults are set for properties of an F-runtime group:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.6 F-shutdown groups

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

Converting F-data types to standard data types

If you need the standard user program to process data from the F-program further (for monitoring on the PCS 7 OS, for example), a block for F_FDatatype_Datatype data conversion will have to be interconnected in the user program so that the F-data types can be converted into standard data types. This converter blocks must be called in the standard user program (standard runtime group).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

- F module driver for F-signal modules with outputs or with inputs and outputs
- F-communications blocks and F-system blocks for sending
- F block F_PLK_O
- F block F_DIAG (S7 F-Systems Lib V1_3 and higher)

The run sequence of the blocks listed under items 1 and 5 is adjusted automatically when the F-program is compiled.
As if S7 F Systems Lib V1_3, separate runtime groups are created for the F blocks listed under points 1 and 5 during the first compilation.
The IPO principle (input, process, output) must always be observed when placing F-channel drivers and F-blocks for user logic.
This ensures that all inputs are read first, the relevant processing steps are performed, and all outputs are then written.
Furthermore, F-runtime groups and F-monitoring blocks that are only visible following compilation are also added automatically.

Note

No changes may be made in the automatically added runtime groups with the exception of the scan cycle monitoring on ""F_CYC_CO"" blocks and the parameter assignment of the ""F_SHUTDN"" block.

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

@F_OUT_xx_y Blocks which further process output values of F-blocks (communication send blocks, conversion blocks from F-to standard data types, drivers for F-output modules, F_PLK, F_PLK_O, and F_DIAG for program sequence control)

@F_DbInitxx DB_INIT function block required for the cold restart of an F-runtime group

All required error OBs are added to the block container in the SIMATIC Manager.

There should only be one @F_IN_xx_y runtime group before the first F-user runtime group and one @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group after the last F-user runtime group. If the safety program consists of several shutdown groups (see section 6.2.6 (Page 87)), there is the @F_IN_xx_y and @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group both before and after the F-user runtime group in the shutdown groups.

# Rules for F-runtime groups in the safety program

- We recommend that you proceed as follows in order to make the lengths of the F-cycles as uniform as possible:
If you mix F-and standard runtime groups in a cyclic interrupt OB, you must execute the F-runtime groups before the standard runtime groups.
- The following defaults are set for properties of an F-runtime group:
- Reduction ratio = 1
- Phase offset = 0
- Properties Runtime Group
- Task: 0B37
- Name: HS104
- Comment:
- Reduction ratio:
- Phase offset:
- Optimize run sequence
- Active:
- You are not permitted to move automatically generated F-runtime groups (identified by @).

Note: The feature: Optimize Run Sequence in CFC can lead to a change in the collective signature and impair the response times of the safety program, and therefore should not be used in F-runtime groups.

With PCS 7 V7.0 SP1 and higher, it is no longer possible to optimize the run sequence for cyclic interrupt OBs with F-runtime groups.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.6 F-shutdown groups

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

- F block F_DIAG (S7 F-Systems Lib V1_3 and higher)

The run sequence of the blocks listed under items 1 and 5 is adjusted automatically when the F-program is compiled.
As if S7 F Systems Lib V1_3, separate runtime groups are created for the F blocks listed under points 1 and 5 during the first compilation.
The IPO principle (input, process, output) must always be observed when placing F-channel drivers and F-blocks for user logic.
This ensures that all inputs are read first, the relevant processing steps are performed, and all outputs are then written.
Furthermore, F-runtime groups and F-monitoring blocks that are only visible following compilation are also added automatically.

Note

No changes may be made in the automatically added runtime groups with the exception of the scan cycle monitoring on ""F_CYC_CO"" blocks and the parameter assignment of the ""F_SHUTDN"" block.

All required error OBs are added to the block container in the SIMATIC Manager.

There should only be one @F_IN_xx_y runtime group before the first F-user runtime group and one @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group after the last F-user runtime group. If the safety program consists of several shutdown groups (see section 6.2.6 (Page 87)), there is the @F_IN_xx_y and @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group both before and after the F-user runtime group in the shutdown groups.

# Rules for F-runtime groups in the safety program

- We recommend that you proceed as follows in order to make the lengths of the F-cycles as uniform as possible:
If you mix F-and standard runtime groups in a cyclic interrupt OB, you must execute the F-runtime groups before the standard runtime groups.
- The following defaults are set for properties of an F-runtime group:
- Reduction ratio = 1
- Phase offset = 0
- Properties Runtime Group

- You are not permitted to move automatically generated F-runtime groups (identified by @).

Note: The feature: Optimize Run Sequence in CFC can lead to a change in the collective signature and impair the response times of the safety program, and therefore should not be used in F-runtime groups.

With PCS 7 V7.0 SP1 and higher, it is no longer possible to optimize the run sequence for cyclic interrupt OBs with F-runtime groups.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.6 F-shutdown groups

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

Converting F-data types to standard data types

If you need the standard user program to process data from the F-program further (for monitoring on the PCS 7 OS, for example), a block for F_FDatatype_Datatype data conversion will have to be interconnected in the user program so that the F-data types can be converted into standard data types. This converter blocks must be called in the standard user program (standard runtime group).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

Converting F-data types to standard data types

If you need the standard user program to process data from the F-program further (for monitoring on the PCS 7 OS, for example), a block for F_FDatatype_Datatype data conversion will have to be interconnected in the user program so that the F-data types can be converted into standard data types. This converter blocks must be called in the standard user program (standard runtime group).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

Furthermore, F-runtime groups and F-monitoring blocks that are only visible following compilation are also added automatically.

@F_DbInitxx DB_INIT function block required for the cold restart of an F-runtime group

All required error OBs are added to the block container in the SIMATIC Manager.

There should only be one @F_IN_xx_y runtime group before the first F-user runtime group and one @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group after the last F-user runtime group. If the safety program consists of several shutdown groups (see section 6.2.6 (Page 87)), there is the @F_IN_xx_y and @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group both before and after the F-user runtime group in the shutdown groups.

# Rules for F-runtime groups in the safety program

- We recommend that you proceed as follows in order to make the lengths of the F-cycles as uniform as possible:
If you mix F-and standard runtime groups in a cyclic interrupt OB, you must execute the F-runtime groups before the standard runtime groups.
- The following defaults are set for properties of an F-runtime group:
- Reduction ratio = 1
- Phase offset = 0
- Properties Runtime Group
- Task: 0B37
- Name: HS104
- Comment:
- Reduction ratio:
- Phase offset:
- Optimize run sequence
- Active:
- You are not permitted to move automatically generated F-runtime groups (identified by @).

Note: The feature: Optimize Run Sequence in CFC can lead to a change in the collective signature and impair the response times of the safety program, and therefore should not be used in F-runtime groups.

With PCS 7 V7.0 SP1 and higher, it is no longer possible to optimize the run sequence for cyclic interrupt OBs with F-runtime groups.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.6 F-shutdown groups

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.6 F-shutdown groups

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

# 7.2.4 Run sequence of F-blocks

# Defining the run sequence

You define the run sequence in the CFC editor in the same way as for a standard user program. Changing the run sequence also changes the collective signature.

# Correct run sequence of F-blocks

The sequence of the F-blocks within the F-shutdown group is relevant. The number of F-runtime groups the F-shutdown group has been split into is of no relevance. Essentially, the correct run sequence of the various F-block types is as follows:

1. Placed automatically:
- F module driver for F-signal modules with inputs or with inputs and outputs
- F-communications blocks and F-system blocks for receiving
- F blocks for data conversion from standard value to F-structure
- F modules with OS connection
2. F channel drivers for inputs
3. F blocks for user logic

- F module driver for F-signal modules with outputs or with inputs and outputs
- F-communications blocks and F-system blocks for sending
- F block F_PLK_O
- F block F_DIAG (S7 F-Systems Lib V1_3 and higher)

The run sequence of the blocks listed under items 1 and 5 is adjusted automatically when the F-program is compiled.
As if S7 F Systems Lib V1_3, separate runtime groups are created for the F blocks listed under points 1 and 5 during the first compilation.
The IPO principle (input, process, output) must always be observed when placing F-channel drivers and F-blocks for user logic.
This ensures that all inputs are read first, the relevant processing steps are performed, and all outputs are then written.
Furthermore, F-runtime groups and F-monitoring blocks that are only visible following compilation are also added automatically.

Note

No changes may be made in the automatically added runtime groups with the exception of the scan cycle monitoring on ""F_CYC_CO"" blocks and the parameter assignment of the ""F_SHUTDN"" block.

# 7.2.4 Run sequence of F-blocks

# Defining the run sequence

You define the run sequence in the CFC editor in the same way as for a standard user program. Changing the run sequence also changes the collective signature.

# Correct run sequence of F-blocks

The sequence of the F-blocks within the F-shutdown group is relevant. The number of F-runtime groups the F-shutdown group has been split into is of no relevance. Essentially, the correct run sequence of the various F-block types is as follows:

1. Placed automatically:
- F module driver for F-signal modules with inputs or with inputs and outputs
- F-communications blocks and F-system blocks for receiving
- F blocks for data conversion from standard value to F-structure
- F modules with OS connection
2. F channel drivers for inputs
3. F blocks for user logic

1. F channel drivers for outputs
2. Placed automatically:
- F block F_PLK
- F block F_PSG_M
- F module driver for F-signal modules with outputs or with inputs and outputs
- F-communications blocks and F-system blocks for sending
- F block F_PLK_O
- F block F_DIAG (S7 F-Systems Lib V1_3 and higher)

The run sequence of the blocks listed under items 1 and 5 is adjusted automatically when the F-program is compiled.
As if S7 F Systems Lib V1_3, separate runtime groups are created for the F blocks listed under points 1 and 5 during the first compilation.
The IPO principle (input, process, output) must always be observed when placing F-channel drivers and F-blocks for user logic.
This ensures that all inputs are read first, the relevant processing steps are performed, and all outputs are then written.
Furthermore, F-runtime groups and F-monitoring blocks that are only visible following compilation are also added automatically.

Note

No changes may be made in the automatically added runtime groups with the exception of the scan cycle monitoring on ""F_CYC_CO"" blocks and the parameter assignment of the ""F_SHUTDN"" block.

# 7.2.5 F-runtime groups

During the programming of the safety program, F-blocks cannot be inserted directly into tasks (cyclic interrupt OBs). When a new CFC chart is created in PCS 7, the system will automatically generate a runtime group of the same name, into which the F-blocks placed in the corresponding CFC chart can then be inserted. An F-runtime group only becomes an F-runtime group (identified by a yellow folder and ""F"") when F-blocks are called in it.

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

@F_OUT_xx_y Blocks which further process output values of F-blocks (communication send blocks, conversion blocks from F-to standard data types, drivers for F-output modules, F_PLK, F_PLK_O, and F_DIAG for program sequence control)

@F_DbInitxx DB_INIT function block required for the cold restart of an F-runtime group

All required error OBs are added to the block container in the SIMATIC Manager.

There should only be one @F_IN_xx_y runtime group before the first F-user runtime group and one @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group after the last F-user runtime group. If the safety program consists of several shutdown groups (see section 6.2.6 (Page 87)), there is the @F_IN_xx_y and @F_OUT_xx_y runtime group both before and after the F-user runtime group in the shutdown groups.

# Rules for F-runtime groups in the safety program

- We recommend that you proceed as follows in order to make the lengths of the F-cycles as uniform as possible:
If you mix F-and standard runtime groups in a cyclic interrupt OB, you must execute the F-runtime groups before the standard runtime groups.
- The following defaults are set for properties of an F-runtime group:
- Reduction ratio = 1
- Phase offset = 0
- Properties Runtime Group
- Task: 0B37
- Name: HS104
- Comment:
- Reduction ratio:
- Phase offset:
- Optimize run sequence
- Active:
- You are not permitted to move automatically generated F-runtime groups (identified by @).

Note: The feature: Optimize Run Sequence in CFC can lead to a change in the collective signature and impair the response times of the safety program, and therefore should not be used in F-runtime groups.

With PCS 7 V7.0 SP1 and higher, it is no longer possible to optimize the run sequence for cyclic interrupt OBs with F-runtime groups.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

# 7.2.6 F-shutdown groups

An F-shutdown group is a self-contained unit in your safety program. It contains user logic which is executed or shut down simultaneously. The F-shutdown group contains one or a number of F-runtime groups which are assigned to a common cyclic interrupt OB. You can choose whether an error during execution of the safety program causes a full shutdown or a partial shutdown of the safety program. With a partial shutdown, only the F-shutdown group in which the error occurred is shut down.

# Rules for F-shutdown groups in the safety program

You are not permitted to directly interconnect F-blocks in different F-shutdown groups. Data can only be exchanged between F-shutdown groups using special communication blocks (F_S_xx, F_R_xx for F_BOOL and F_REAL data structures). Therefore, all F-channel drivers in an F-signal module must be in the same F-shutdown group, together with the module driver of the F-signal module.

# Defining F-shutdown groups

As soon as you place F-blocks in the CFC editor for the first time, all of the F-runtime groups in a single cyclic interrupt OB will form an F-shutdown group. You can configure each F-runtime group as the last F-runtime group in an F-shutdown group by placing the F_PSG_M ""selection block"". The F-system then creates a new F-shutdown group for all subsequent F-runtime groups until another F_PSG_M block is found.

# Distribution/Combination by means of manual placing of F_PSG_M

If you add or delete one or a number of F_PSG_M blocks in your project, the order of your F-shutdown groups will change. If you make a change to the layout of your F-shutdown groups, you must make sure that the F-module drivers and all assigned F-channel drivers are integrated in the same F-shutdown group. You can split one F-shutdown group into two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the CFC editor's runtime editor, place the F_PSG_M block in the last F-runtime group which is to be assigned to the first F-shutdown group. All subsequent F-runtime groups will then be assigned to the second F-shutdown group. The number of F-shutdown groups is limited to 110 in all cyclic interrupt OBs. The system restricts the number of F-runtime groups in an F-shutdown group. You have the option of combining two F-shutdown groups. To do this, in the runtime editor of the CFC editor, delete the F_PSG_M block between the F-shutdown groups. If you combine a number of F-shutdown groups which exchange data via F-communication blocks in a single F-shutdown group, you need to remove these F-communications blocks and replace them with direct interconnections.

# Programming data exchange between F-shutdown groups

If you wish to exchange data between two F-shutdown groups, you are not permitted to interconnect the inputs and outputs directly. You need to use the following F-system blocks for data exchange between F blocks in different F-shutdown groups:

|F block|Description|
|---|---|
|F_S_R/F_R_R|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_REAL type|
|F_S_BO/F_R_BO|Safe transfer of 5 data of the F_BOOL type|

# Procedure for data exchange

1. In the F-shutdown group from which data is to be transferred, add an F_S_R or F_S_BO type F-block.
2. In the F-shutdown group to which data is to be transferred, add an F_R_R or F_R_BO type F-block.
3. Interconnect the SD_R_xx inputs of the F_S_R or the SD_BO_xx inputs of the F_S_BO with the data to be transferred.
4. Interconnect the RD_R_xx outputs of the F_R_R or the RD_BO_xx outputs of the F_R_BO with the inputs of the F-block for further processing of the data received.
5. Interconnect the S_DB output of the send block with the S_DB input of the associated receive block.
6. Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the F_R_R and F_R_BO receive blocks with the F-monitoring time calculated.
7. Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a shutdown of the sending shutdown group.

The standard program and the F-program use different data formats. Accordingly, special conversion blocks have to be used for data exchange.

Converting F-data types to standard data types

If you need the standard user program to process data from the F-program further (for monitoring on the PCS 7 OS, for example), a block for F_FDatatype_Datatype data conversion will have to be interconnected in the user program so that the F-data types can be converted into standard data types. This converter blocks must be called in the standard user program (standard runtime group).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

Standard and F-blocks are in different runtime groups. As shown here, some F-blocks have outputs (depicted in gray), which can be directly interconnected with standard PCS 7 blocks. PCS 7 blocks such as MonAnL, MonDiL, EventMESSAGE and their associated faceplates and process symbols are used to visualize fail-safe analog values and status messages as well as system states and operating states. If parameters cannot be directly further interconnected due to the safety data format, the conversion blocks described above can be used.

# Converting standard data types into F-data types

If data from the standard user program is to be processed further in the F-program, it will need to be converted. The blocks for data conversion from standard data types to F-data types (F_datatype_Fdatatype) can only be used in the F-program (F-runtime group).

Extract from an F-chart, conversion from REAL to F_REAL:

|7_R_FR_CONv|R -B|CE 32|CB39|:RELL|Aulci|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DAII ZROC3?|VALUE DiT| | | | |

Note: The conversion blocks only perform data conversion; in other words, you will need to program additional measures in the F-program for plausibility checking purposes (with F_LIM_R, for example), in order to ensure that only non-hazardous values are possible.

# 7.2.8 How F-blocks with floating-point operations respond to number range overflows

Within the context of analog value processing, number range overflows/underflows can occur during arithmetic calculations (with division by 0, root from a negative number or number range overflow). With S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 and higher, the response is as follows in this case: The results ""Overflow (± infinite)"", ""Denormalized floating-point number"" or ""Invalid floating-point number (NaN)"" are:

- Either output at the output and can be processed further by subsequent F blocks
- Or signaled to special outputs. A substitute value is output if necessary.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.2 Creating the safety program

If the floating-point operation produces an invalid floating-point number (NaN) and no invalid floating-point number (NaN) existed as an address prior to this, the following diagnostics event will be entered in the F CPU's diagnostic buffer:

""Safety program: Invalid REAL number in DB"" (event ID 16#75D9)

You can use this entry in the diagnostic buffer to identify the F block with the invalid floating-point number (NaN).

If you are not able to prevent these events from occurring in your safety program, you will need to decide, on the basis of your application, whether you wish to respond to them in your safety program.

# Procedure

Follow the steps outlined below:

1. Add the send block (F_SENDBO/F_SENDR) to the safety program from which data is to be transmitted.
2. Add the receive block (F_RCVBO/F_RCVR) to the safety program to which data is to be transmitted.
3. Assign the relevant IDs of the configured S7 connections to the ""ID"" inputs.
4. Configure the R_ID inputs. This defines the relationship between a send block and a receive block:

The associated fail-safe blocks are assigned the same (freely selectable, uneven value for R_ID. Please note that the R_ID+1 value is also assigned automatically.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.3 Configuring fail-safe AS-AS communication

# Procedure

Follow the steps outlined below:

1. Add the send block (F_SENDBO/F_SENDR) to the safety program from which data is to be transmitted.
2. Add the receive block (F_RCVBO/F_RCVR) to the safety program to which data is to be transmitted.
3. Assign the relevant IDs of the configured S7 connections to the ""ID"" inputs.
4. Configure the R_ID inputs. This defines the relationship between a send block and a receive block:

The associated fail-safe blocks are assigned the same (freely selectable, uneven value for R_ID. Please note that the R_ID+1 value is also assigned automatically.

# 7.3 Configuring fail-safe AS-AS communication

Like standard communication, safety-related communication between the safety programs of F CPUs via S7 connections is implemented using connection tables in NetPro.

In S7 F/FH systems, safety-related communication via S7 connections is possible between all 41x-xH CPUs.

As of S7 F Systems V6.0 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3, fail-safe communication to S7 Distributed Safety is also supported with the following F CPUs:

- CPU 416F
- CPU 31xF

Note: Safety-related AS-AS communication is not permitted via public networks.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.3 Configuring fail-safe AS-AS communication

# 7.3.1 Configuring S7 connections

Configure S7 connections for safety-related AS-AS communication in exactly the same way as for standard communication (you might need also need to set up a fault-tolerant S7 connection).

Note

You can find instructions on how to do this in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines"".

During communication between automation systems in various subprojects, please make sure that the S7 subnet ID is the same in each of the respective projects. This ID is involved in the calculation of the CRC sum at the send and receive blocks and must, therefore, be the same in each case.

# 7.3 Configuring fail-safe AS-AS communication

Like standard communication, safety-related communication between the safety programs of F CPUs via S7 connections is implemented using connection tables in NetPro.

In S7 F/FH systems, safety-related communication via S7 connections is possible between all 41x-xH CPUs.

As of S7 F Systems V6.0 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3, fail-safe communication to S7 Distributed Safety is also supported with the following F CPUs:

- CPU 416F
- CPU 31xF

Note: Safety-related AS-AS communication is not permitted via public networks.

# 7.3.1 Configuring S7 connections

Configure S7 connections for safety-related AS-AS communication in exactly the same way as for standard communication (you might need also need to set up a fault-tolerant S7 connection).

Note

You can find instructions on how to do this in the ""SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines"".

During communication between automation systems in various subprojects, please make sure that the S7 subnet ID is the same in each of the respective projects. This ID is involved in the calculation of the CRC sum at the send and receive blocks and must, therefore, be the same in each case.

# Procedure

Follow the steps outlined below:

1. Add the send block (F_SENDBO/F_SENDR) to the safety program from which data is to be transmitted.
2. Add the receive block (F_RCVBO/F_RCVR) to the safety program to which data is to be transmitted.
3. Assign the relevant IDs of the configured S7 connections to the ""ID"" inputs.
4. Configure the R_ID inputs. This defines the relationship between a send block and a receive block:

The associated fail-safe blocks are assigned the same (freely selectable, uneven value for R_ID. Please note that the R_ID+1 value is also assigned automatically.

Note

If the S7 connections between the automation systems have been changed, the safety program will need to be recompiled. User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following PROFIsafe communication errors (ACK_REQ output set).

Configure the TIMEOUT inputs of the send and receive blocks with the same calculated timeout value.
Configure the receive block substitute values for the scenario of a communication fault. Communication is established internally in both directions (sending and receiving) for the F-communication. Keep in the mind the maximum communication load of the AS.

If the maximum communications load of a system is 100 requests per second, for example, this results in a total of 20 communications requests with 5 F_RECVX and 5 F_SENDX-B blocks. If these are configured in OB 37 (1 s), this corresponds to a communication load of 20%. These blocks, which are integrated into OB 38 (300 ms), correspond to a communication load of 66%.

As of S7 F Systems Lib V1.3 SP2, the fail-safe communication blocks have the new input parameter, ""COMMVER_USED"".

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|
|---|---|
|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Create password for safety program| | |

|Remaining validity (in minutes):| | |
|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|---|---|---|
|Cancel| | |
|Enter value| | |
|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

|Logout|Cancel|Help|

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

|Enter value for MAX_CYC (in ms) for Task OB37|Current value: 0 ms|3000|
| |Help| |

The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3,000 milliseconds.

Check whether this setting is suitable for your process. Change the default if necessary.

Note

You can change the default value at the MAX_CYC input of the F_CYC_CO block in chart @F_CycCo-OB3x whenever you wish.

You can find information about setting the F-monitoring time and response times in section ""Monitoring times and system response times (Page 137)"".

# 7.8.3 Compiling the S7 program

During compilation, the S7 program is automatically expanded to include diagnostics drivers (contained in the @ system charts) and F-specific parts. F system blocks are stored in @F_xxxx charts.

Placements, interconnections, and parameter assignments for F-system blocks completed automatically during the compilation process must not be changed.

You must not change or delete F blocks in the block container.

The CFC compiler also automatically places F system blocks needed for the operation of the safety program in runtime groups. The names of these runtime groups begin with ""@F_"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|
|---|---|
|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

|Value 0|Automatic reintegration without user acknowledgment|

|Value 1|Prompt for user acknowledgment for reintegration following error elimination|

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note
The figure is available in its original size as appendix to the manual in the ZIP download of the checklists.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

# 7.4.4 Causes of errors

Errors that trigger an F-STOP:

- Distortion of:
- Data
- Program sequence
- Code
- CPU error

Errors that always trigger an F-STOP with full shutdown:

Irrespective of the parameter assignment for F-STOP, a full shutdown is always triggered in the event of a cyclic interrupt OB request error (caused by a CPU/OB overload, for example).

Error in master:

Before a safety program in a redundant F CPU goes into F-STOP, it completes the following steps:

- The S7 F/FH system performs a master-to-standby switchover.
- The previous master goes into the configured operating state (default setting: TROUBLESHOOTING).

If no errors are detected, the F CPU reconnects.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

If an error is detected, the previous master goes into FAULT mode (all LEDs on the affected CPU flash).

On redundant F CPUs, errors on one communications partner will not stop program execution.

# Error in both F CPUs:

The safety program goes into F-STOP immediately.

# 7.4.6 Exiting an F-STOP

Run an F-startup as described in the following chapter.

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.1 F-startup

S7 F-systems do not make a distinction between a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart. Exceptions to this rule are the F-blocks F_CHG_BO, F_CHG_R (component of the Safety Data Write function), F_MOV_R (as of S7 F Systems Lib V1_3), F_SWC_CB and F_SWC_CR (component of the ""Secure Write Command++"" function).

Both a CPU cold restart and a CPU warm restart will generate an F-startup. With an F-startup, the safety program launches automatically with the initial values.

An F-startup is performed:

- After a CPU STOP, when you perform an F-CPU warm restart
- After an F-STOP, when the ""F_SHUTDN"" F-block detects a positive edge at the RESTART input

Following a partial shutdown of the safety program, only the F-shutdown groups involved in the F-STOP perform an F-startup. F shutdown groups with errors remain in F-STOP.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.5 F startup and (re)start protection

# 7.5.2 (Re)start protection

If the process does not permit the safety program to start up automatically with the initial values, you will need to program a response to F-startup.

The F_START F-block is used to signal an F-startup of the safety program with the initial values. The COLDSTRT output parameter tells you that an F-startup has been triggered.

In this example, a flip-flop is set when the F-program is started up, which passivates the output drivers. Once all the process conditions have been fulfilled, the operator can release the F-output signals by resetting the flip-flop using the F-acknowledgment function (F_QUITES block).

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the restart of F I/Os via the ES/OS with ""Safety Write Command++"" (""SWC++"") (F_SWC_BO and SWC_QOS). You can find additional information about using SWC_QOS in the section Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS) (Page 120).

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.6 I/O access via F channel driver blocks

In S7 F systems, F signal modules are accessed via F channel driver blocks and not via the process image. For this purpose, the following driver blocks are used in the program:

- F channel driver (e.g. F_CH_xx) for access to the input/output channels of F signal modules. One F-channel driver is required for every input or output channel used. Only one F-channel driver is required for redundant channels.

In your safety program, F channel drivers provide the interface with a channel of an F signal module and perform signal processing. F channel drivers vary depending on the F-signal modules. They are placed and interconnected in the safety program by the user.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The CFC compiler creates and interconnects one F-module driver per module for PROFIsafe communication purposes.

Note

When changing the address of an F_CH_AI channel driver block via delta download, read the following FAQ:
What do you have to consider if you want to transfer an address change to an F_CH_AI channel driver module via a delta download?

# 7.7 Passivation - general

Passivation means that in the event of an error, one or a number of channels on an F signal module are switched to a safe state.
In the event of a channel error (a faulty sensor, for example), only the affected channel is passivated.

In the event of a module error (a communication error, for example), all channels on the fail-safe I/O module are passivated.

If an F signal module detects an error, it switches the affected channel or all of its channels to the safe state;
in other words, the channels on this module are passivated. The fail-safe F signal module sends a message to the F channel driver
and the PCS 7 OS to indicate that it has detected an error.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

The PASS_ON input can also be used to activate and deactivate the passivation of a channel in the safety program, e.g. by using a specific condition in the program sequence or restart protection.

When output channels are passivated, the outputs are de-energized (set to a zero-current or zero-voltage state). The F channel driver of a passivated digital output channel issues a substitute value with the quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1.

When input channels are passivated, substitute values are forwarded to the safety program, regardless of the actual process signal. The F channel driver of a passivated digital input channel outputs substitute value 0 with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 and the QBAD output is set to 1. In accordance with the parameter assignment at the SUBS_ON input, the F channel driver of an analog input channel will output either a substitute value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#48 or the last valid value with quality code (QUALITY) 16#44. The QBAD output is also set to 1 and, if a substitute value is output, the QSUBS output is set to 1.

# 7.7.2 Group passivation

If, during passivation of an F-I/O or a channel of an F-I/O, you wish to activate passivation of other F-I/Os, you can use the PASS_OUT output/PASS_ON input to perform group passivation of related F-I/Os.

Group passivation via PASS_OUT/PASS_ON can be used, for example, to force the simultaneous re-integration of all F I/Os after the S7 F system starts.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.3 Reintegration following elimination of errors

Reintegration means:

- Valid process values start to be output again at the output channels of the fail-safe output modules.
- The F-channel drivers associated with the fail-safe input modules resume the forwarding of valid process values to the safety program.
- Once a channel error has been eliminated, a channel on a fail-safe module can be reintegrated automatically or following user acknowledgment. You can use the ACK_NEC input of an F-channel driver to specify whether or not user acknowledgment is required:

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

# 7.7.4 Automatic reintegration on channel error

If the ACK_NEC input is not set and once a channel error has been corrected, the affected channel is reintegrated automatically (depassivated) as follows:

- With input modules - immediately
- With output modules - within a matter of minutes (due to required test signal injections, after 2 successful test cycles).

Note
User acknowledgment is always required for reintegration following module errors (ACK_REQ output set), even if ACK_NEC has not been set. An interconnection of the ACK_REI input with an automatically generated signal is not permitted.

# 7.7.5 Programming reintegration following module errors or channel errors requiring acknowledgment

A value of 1 at the ACK_REQ output of the F-channel driver indicates that the error has been eliminated and user acknowledgment for reintegration is possible. When the ACK_NEC input is set, reintegration of the input or output channel is only performed on a positive edge at the ACK_REI input of the F-channel driver.

# Options for user acknowledgment

- An acknowledgment button is connected to a fail-safe digital input module
- Manual input of an ES or a local operating station via the F_QUITES block

Note

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.7 Passivation and reintegration of input/output channels

If you use an acknowledgment button for user acknowledgment, in the event of a module error on the F-signal module group to which the acknowledgment button has been connected, you will no longer be able to trigger acknowledgment to reintegrate this F-signal module group. An additional acknowledgment option must be provided for this module group, for example: using an ""F_QUITES"" block.

Note

Automatic user acknowledgment is not permitted.

Note

You can find additional information about programming fail-safe acknowledgment with ""Secure Write Command++"" in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100)"".

# Procedure for programming the fail-safe user acknowledgment via an operator station

1. Add the F_QUITES F-block to your safety program. You can access the acknowledgment signal for evaluation for user acknowledgments at the output OUT of F_QUITES.
2. Interconnect the OUT output of F_QUITES with the ACK_REI input of the F-channel drivers.
3. Collect the ""ACK_REQ"" channel driver outputs via an OR (OR04 or OR08) in the standard user program. Signal the output signal of the OR logic operation as an acknowledgment request on the operating station.
4. Set up a button or a text box on your operator station for writing the ""6"" acknowledgment value (1st acknowledgment step).
5. Optional: After the first operating step, the Q output of the F_QUITES block displays the request for the second operating step for 60s. You can use the signal to display a second key or second text box.
6. Set up a second button or a text box on your operating station for writing the ""9"" acknowledgment value (2nd acknowledgment step).
7. After the second operating step, the F_QUITES block outputs a pulse at the OUT output with which the connected F channel drivers are acknowledged.

Note

Automatic reintegration using F_QUITES: The non-safety-related input IN of F_QUITES must not be interconnected with a signal or described by a signal which generates the above condition (change from 6 to 9 within a minute) automatically for a fail-safe acknowledgment. Fail-safe acknowledgment must only be generated by means of a conscious manual entry on the ES/OS (not automatically in the program).

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

If an S7 program contains charts with F blocks, these will be compiled when the CFC charts are compiled. Measures for eliminating errors will also be expanded and additional safety-relevant checks carried out.

# 7.8.1 Password protection for safety-related functions and settings

A password protects the fail-safe program and the parameters of the F-modules against unauthorized changes. The password is requested when accessing fail-safe parts of the system, e.g. when editing a fail-safe CFC, when compiling changes in the safety program or when opening the properties of a fail-safe module in the hardware configuration.

As of S7 F Systems V6.2, you can use a more secure password by activating the ""Increased password security"" option box; this must comply with the ""Conditions for a secure password"":

- Password length: minimum 8, maximum 32 characters
- At least one capital letter of the Latin alphabet (A - Z); also diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet (a- z); also ""ß"" and diacritical characters (umlauts and letters with accents)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one of the following special characters: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * _ - + = ` | \ ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' "" < > , . ? /

Note

We recommend using the ""Increased password security"" option in the ""Create password for safety program"" dialog, but this option can only be used in ""F-Systems"" projects without the Safety Matrix.

For projects with Safety Matrix, this option must be disabled unless otherwise stated in the Safety Matrix product. For more information, refer to the documentation of the respective version of Safety Matrix.

If the password is entered, it remains valid for one hour. If you have finished your work, reset the password's period of validity.

To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. There you can find the ""Password"" button that opens the ""Create Password for Safety Program"" window. The ""Clear"" button sets the validity period to ""0"".

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.8 Compiling the F-program

You also have the option of changing the password.

If a standard user program and a fail-safe program are running in one CPU, changes to the standard part can be compiled without the need to enter the F-password. This assumes that no changes have been made to the safety program.

# 7.8.2 Parameterizing the maximum F cycle monitoring time

The F-CPU runs F-cycle time monitoring for every cyclic interrupt OB containing F-runtime groups. The first time the F-program is compiled, for each cyclic interrupt OB which contains an F-program you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) that may elapse between two calls of this cyclic interrupt OB.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.9 Safety mode and downloading the safety program

Safety mode of the safety program in the F-CPU can be temporarily deactivated and reactivated. This enables you to make changes to the safety program in RUN mode.

# 7.9.1 Information on safety mode

An S7-400 F/FH system containing a fail-safe program automatically goes into safety mode when it starts up. In safety mode, all functions present in the system for system error detection and for the fail-safe user program are activated. In this state it is not possible to modify the safety program in active operation (RUN).

In order to make online changes to fail-safe parameters from the CFC online, or to download changes in the fail-safe program, part of the diagnostics functions must be switched off. Safety mode must be deactivated for this purpose, before changes are made online or downloaded.

Prior to deactivating safety mode, you must ensure that the process is in a non-critical state and is being monitored by an operator during this time (monitored operation).

To download program changes in deactivated safety mode, the monitoring parts are switched off, which would detect software changes and trigger an F-STOP. ""Random hardware faults"" continue to be detected and the diagnostics for the modules remain active. The safety program continues to be processed to ensure that a ""Demand"" from the field leads to activation of the safety function.

Once the changes have been made, or at the end of the download process, safety mode must be reactivated immediately. The risk analysis may reveal details of other measures that are required.

# 7.9.2 Deactivating safety mode

Safety mode can be deactivated/activated if a relevant system prompt appears, or from the SIMATIC Manager. To do this, select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant window.

The field underneath the ""Safety Mode..."" button shows you whether safety mode is ""activated"" or ""deactivated"". If the safety program does not match the safety program in the F-CPU or communication with the F-CPU has failed, ""unknown"" will appear here.

If there is a connection between the engineering station and the CPU, the current status of the safety program is displayed and can be changed using the ""Safety Mode..."" button. An additional prompt appears before the status is changed.

The safety mode status is entered in the CPU diagnostic buffer and reported on the OS, and can be checked in chart @F_Shutdn at the SAFE_M output of the F_SHUTDN block.

# 7.10.1 Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)

# Introduction

From within the OS, you have the option of re-integrating F I/Os via the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" function.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the re-integration of F I/Os via ES/OS with ""SWC++"".

The function for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" consists of several blocks:

- Three F components, which you integrate into the CFCs of your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_QOS: Interface for displaying the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function on the OS.
- A faceplate that you can integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

With ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"", you can re-integrate F channel drivers into the safety program of an F CPU if you execute a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Operator types for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

Note
As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

With the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function, the OS can generate fail-safe pulses in the F program of the automation system. For the F parameters, there is a block (""F_SWC_BO"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output for visualization of the current value is interconnected to the ""SWC_QOS"" block.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_BO"" block to the ""AKT_Q"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" block for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Connect the ""OUT"" output on the F block ""F_SWC_BO"" to the inputs ACK_REI of the F blocks which are to be re-integrated from the OS by the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"".

Connect the ""ACK_REQ"" output of the fail-safe channel driver devices to the ""ACK_REQ"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" device for the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Note
One ""SWC_QOS"" must be placed for each operator function and inserted into the plant hierarchy...

Function-related names are to be assigned to the ""SWC_QOS"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0"").

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

Note

The following functions are recommended for changing fail-safe parameters from a PCS 7 OS:

- Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)
- Change process values (SWC_CHG)
- Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

# 7.10.1 Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)

# Introduction

From within the OS, you have the option of re-integrating F I/Os via the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" function.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the re-integration of F I/Os via ES/OS with ""SWC++"".

The function for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" consists of several blocks:

- Three F components, which you integrate into the CFCs of your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_QOS: Interface for displaying the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function on the OS.
- A faceplate that you can integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

With ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"", you can re-integrate F channel drivers into the safety program of an F CPU if you execute a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Operator types for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

Note

The following functions are recommended for changing fail-safe parameters from a PCS 7 OS:

- Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)
- Change process values (SWC_CHG)
- Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

# 7.10.1 Fail-safe acknowledgment (SWC_QOS)

# Introduction

From within the OS, you have the option of re-integrating F I/Os via the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" function.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, you can control the re-integration of F I/Os via ES/OS with ""SWC++"".

The function for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" consists of several blocks:

- Three F components, which you integrate into the CFCs of your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_QOS: Interface for displaying the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function on the OS.
- A faceplate that you can integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

With ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"", you can re-integrate F channel drivers into the safety program of an F CPU if you execute a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# Operator types for ""Fail-safe acknowledgment""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the ""SWC_QOS"" faceplate.

Note
As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

With the ""Fail-safe acknowledgment"" function, the OS can generate fail-safe pulses in the F program of the automation system. For the F parameters, there is a block (""F_SWC_BO"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output for visualization of the current value is interconnected to the ""SWC_QOS"" block.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_BO"" block to the ""AKT_Q"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" block for ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

Connect the ""OUT"" output on the F block ""F_SWC_BO"" to the inputs ACK_REI of the F blocks which are to be re-integrated from the OS by the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"".

Connect the ""ACK_REQ"" output of the fail-safe channel driver devices to the ""ACK_REQ"" input on the ""SWC_QOS"" device for the ""fail-safe acknowledgment"" from the OS.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# 7.10.2 Change process values (SWC_CHG)

# Introduction

The ""Change process values"" function offers you the possibility to change F parameters in the safety program of the OS.

For the ""Change process values"" function S7 F Systems:

- Four F blocks, which you integrate into the CFC charts in your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_CB: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- F_SWC_CR: Processing of an F_REAL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_CHG: Interface for displaying the ""Process value change"" function on the OS.
- Associated faceplates, which you integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Change process values""

With the ""Change process values"" function, you can change F parameters in the safety program of an F CPU if you perform a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time. The entire change operation is referred to as a ""transaction"".

# Operator types for ""Change process values""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the corresponding SWC_CHG faceplate.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

With the ""Change process values"" function, a BOOL value can be switched on/off by the OS or a REAL value can be specified. For each F parameter, there is a block (""F_SWC_CB"", ""F_SWC_CR"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output is connected to the ""SWC_CHG"" block to visualize the current value.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_CB"" block to the ""AKT_V_B"" input on the ""SWC_CHG"" block for changing a BOOL value.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_CR"" block to the ""SWC_CHG"" block AKT_V_R input for changing a REAL value.

The changed process value is available for further processing in the safety program at the ""OUT"" output of the ""F_SWC_CB"" and ""F_SWC_CR"" F devices.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

# 7.10.2 Change process values (SWC_CHG)

# Introduction

The ""Change process values"" function offers you the possibility to change F parameters in the safety program of the OS.

For the ""Change process values"" function S7 F Systems:

- Four F blocks, which you integrate into the CFC charts in your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_CB: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- F_SWC_CR: Processing of an F_REAL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_CHG: Interface for displaying the ""Process value change"" function on the OS.
- Associated faceplates, which you integrate into your OS.

# Transaction for ""Change process values""

With the ""Change process values"" function, you can change F parameters in the safety program of an F CPU if you perform a specific operating sequence on the OS within a specified time. The entire change operation is referred to as a ""transaction"".

# Operator types for ""Change process values""

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW. In this process, the system uses the ""CPU Plant Designation"" property or the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you assign a plant designation in the general properties of the CPU in HW Config, there is no need to assign a parameter for the ""IDENT"" input of the ""F_SWC_P"" block. If you place several F_SWC_P protocol blocks for each shutdown group so that several simultaneous operations are possible from the OS, then connect the ADR_OSPA output of F_SWC_P to the ADR_SWC input of the corresponding SWC_CHG faceplate.

Note

As of S7 F Systems V6.2 with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2, it is possible to place several protocol blocks for each shutdown group and thus enable several simultaneous operations from the OS.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10 Operating and changing safety-related parameters on a PCS 7 OS

With the ""Change process values"" function, a BOOL value can be switched on/off by the OS or a REAL value can be specified. For each F parameter, there is a block (""F_SWC_CB"", ""F_SWC_CR"") in the AS at which the assigned signal is available. The fail-safe output of the block is used in the safety program and the standard output is connected to the ""SWC_CHG"" block to visualize the current value.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_CB"" block to the ""AKT_V_B"" input on the ""SWC_CHG"" block for changing a BOOL value.

Connect the ""AKT_VAL"" output on the ""F_SWC_CR"" block to the ""SWC_CHG"" block AKT_V_R input for changing a REAL value.

The changed process value is available for further processing in the safety program at the ""OUT"" output of the ""F_SWC_CB"" and ""F_SWC_CR"" F devices.

Note

One ""SWC_CHG"" must be placed for each operator function and inserted into the plant hierarchy. Function-related names are to be assigned to the ""SWC_CHG"" blocks. The names are displayed in the faceplate and simplify identifying the function.

An ""F_SWC_P"" block is necessary for each shutdown group. It implements a special safety protocol and monitors the required operator sequence from the OS. With the ""EN_SWC"" input of the block, the operation of all transactions in a shutdown group can be enabled (""1"") or disabled (""0"").

# 7.10.3 Maintenance Override Switch (SWC_MOS)

Maintenance Override gives you the option to set bypasses in the safety program from the OS as well as the safety-oriented changing of F-parameters in the safety program of an F-CPU from an OS.

A special safety protocol is used to make changes to F-parameters in safety mode. This meets Safety Integrity Level requirements up to SIL3 in accordance with IEC 61508.

S7 F-systems offers the following for MOS:

- Four F-blocks, which you integrate into the CFC charts in your safety program:
- F_SWC_P: Central control of operation via the OS
- F_SWC_BO: Processing of an F_BOOL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- F_SWC_R: Processing of an F_REAL data type parameter for operation via the OS
- SWC_MOS: Interface for the display of the MOS function on the OS.
- A template for the temporal limitation of the change (SWC_TR)
- Associated faceplates, which you integrate into your OS.

A transaction can only be performed by an individual operator who initiates, checks, and confirms the change. However, one transaction can be performed by two operators. The first operator initiates the change (initiator) and the second re-enters, checks, and confirms the value (confirmer).

Operator authorizations are set in the faceplate properties. The connection IDs are generated by the system automatically, in contrast with SDW.

# 7.10.4 Migration from a ""Safety Data Write""/F_QUITES configuration to the ""Secure Write Command"" configuration (SWC)

# Introduction

The ""S7 F Systems Migration Tool"" can be used to migrate existing projects with configurations for ""Safety Data Write"" (SDW) and fail-safe acknowledgment via the ""F_QUITES"" block in configurations with ""Secure Write Command"" (SWC).

- During migration, blocks of types ""F_CHG_BO"", ""F_CHG_R"" and ""F_QUITES"" are automatically replaced by their corresponding SWC solutions.
- The migration affects the signature of the safety program. Therefore, acceptance of changes to the plant is also required.

The tool is available as ""S7FMigrationTool.exe"" in a zip file. You can find the file on the installation CD in the ""Options\S7FMigrationTool"" directory.

# 7.10.4 Migration from a ""Safety Data Write""/F_QUITES configuration to the ""Secure Write Command"" configuration (SWC)

# Introduction

The ""S7 F Systems Migration Tool"" can be used to migrate existing projects with configurations for ""Safety Data Write"" (SDW) and fail-safe acknowledgment via the ""F_QUITES"" block in configurations with ""Secure Write Command"" (SWC).

- During migration, blocks of types ""F_CHG_BO"", ""F_CHG_R"" and ""F_QUITES"" are automatically replaced by their corresponding SWC solutions.
- The migration affects the signature of the safety program. Therefore, acceptance of changes to the plant is also required.

The tool is available as ""S7FMigrationTool.exe"" in a zip file. You can find the file on the installation CD in the ""Options\S7FMigrationTool"" directory.

# 7.10.4 Migration from a ""Safety Data Write""/F_QUITES configuration to the ""Secure Write Command"" configuration (SWC)

# Introduction

The ""S7 F Systems Migration Tool"" can be used to migrate existing projects with configurations for ""Safety Data Write"" (SDW) and fail-safe acknowledgment via the ""F_QUITES"" block in configurations with ""Secure Write Command"" (SWC).

- During migration, blocks of types ""F_CHG_BO"", ""F_CHG_R"" and ""F_QUITES"" are automatically replaced by their corresponding SWC solutions.
- The migration affects the signature of the safety program. Therefore, acceptance of changes to the plant is also required.

The tool is available as ""S7FMigrationTool.exe"" in a zip file. You can find the file on the installation CD in the ""Options\S7FMigrationTool"" directory.

# 7.10.4 Migration from a ""Safety Data Write""/F_QUITES configuration to the ""Secure Write Command"" configuration (SWC)

# Introduction

The ""S7 F Systems Migration Tool"" can be used to migrate existing projects with configurations for ""Safety Data Write"" (SDW) and fail-safe acknowledgment via the ""F_QUITES"" block in configurations with ""Secure Write Command"" (SWC).

- During migration, blocks of types ""F_CHG_BO"", ""F_CHG_R"" and ""F_QUITES"" are automatically replaced by their corresponding SWC solutions.
- The migration affects the signature of the safety program. Therefore, acceptance of changes to the plant is also required.

The tool is available as ""S7FMigrationTool.exe"" in a zip file. You can find the file on the installation CD in the ""Options\S7FMigrationTool"" directory.

# 7.10.4 Migration from a ""Safety Data Write""/F_QUITES configuration to the ""Secure Write Command"" configuration (SWC)

# Introduction

The ""S7 F Systems Migration Tool"" can be used to migrate existing projects with configurations for ""Safety Data Write"" (SDW) and fail-safe acknowledgment via the ""F_QUITES"" block in configurations with ""Secure Write Command"" (SWC).

- During migration, blocks of types ""F_CHG_BO"", ""F_CHG_R"" and ""F_QUITES"" are automatically replaced by their corresponding SWC solutions.
- The migration affects the signature of the safety program. Therefore, acceptance of changes to the plant is also required.

The tool is available as ""S7FMigrationTool.exe"" in a zip file. You can find the file on the installation CD in the ""Options\S7FMigrationTool"" directory.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.10.5 Operator authorizations for Secure Write Command

Operation with the Secure Write Command functions consists of a two-step action sequence. In the first operating step, the ""Initiator"" initiates the change, after which the ""Confirmer"" checks and confirms the change in the second operating step. These steps can be performed by either a single operator or two different operators. The ""User Administrator"" in WinCC Explorer is used to assign operator authorizations for the user(s).

The default operator authorizations correspond to the user hierarchies from PCS 7:

- Initiator No.5, ""Process operations""

These required operating authorizations can be adapted to the specific project.

You can find additional information about the procedure for assigning rights in the ""User Administrator"" in the manual: ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Operator Station"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516).

Note
When compiling the operator station, the operator authorizations changed on the block icon are overwritten with the preset values. To prevent this, enter the changed attributes in the ""@@PCS7Typicals.CFG"" file.

Note

You can find additional information about the Secure Write Command in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/101509838).

For more information on the structure of the ""@PCS7Tyicals.CFG"" file, refer to the WinCC Information System (Start > Simatic > WinCC > WinCC Information System in contents under Options > Options for Process Control > Graphic Object Update Wizard > Structure of the Configuration File).

# Use of an additional enable (for example, key switch)

During an operation, input EN_SWC must be 1 on the F_SWC_P F block. To ensure that operations can only be performed in certain process states or after enabling, connect the EN_SWC input to the input signal of a key switch or connect it to a logic. If input EN_SWC = 0, all existing bypasses are disabled. However, the configured substitute values are retained.

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

A fail-safe system must switch the process to a safe state within a defined response time in the event of a system error (e.g. CPU failure, F-signal module failure, communications failure, program execution error).

To achieve this, a variety of monitoring times have been implemented to ensure that the affected functions are brought to a safe state if this time is exceeded.

# What is the purpose of monitoring times and system response times?

For the S7-400 F/FH, there are essentially two different types of monitoring/error response:

- If the monitoring times of the fail-safe program are exceeded, the affected F-program switches off and the inputs/outputs of the F-signal modules are passivated.
- If the monitoring time for PROFIsafe communication between the F CPU and F signal modules is exceeded, the inputs/outputs of the affected F signal modules are passivated and the corresponding substitute values are forwarded to the CPU.

Both the availability and the safety of the F/FH system must be taken into account when configuring monitoring times.

- Availability: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently high to prevent time monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present.
- Safety: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently low to prevent the process safety time from being exceeded.

Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0) Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

The rule of thumb is that a non-redundant S7 F/FH system supports shorter monitoring times and, therefore, shorter response times in the event of an error. For a redundant system, longer monitoring times have to be configured to allow for switchover of the components (PROFIBUS, interface modules) and the coupling/updating of the H-CPU.

# Use of an additional enable (for example, key switch)

During an operation, input EN_SWC must be 1 on the F_SWC_P F block. To ensure that operations can only be performed in certain process states or after enabling, connect the EN_SWC input to the input signal of a key switch or connect it to a logic. If input EN_SWC = 0, all existing bypasses are disabled. However, the configured substitute values are retained.

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

A fail-safe system must switch the process to a safe state within a defined response time in the event of a system error (e.g. CPU failure, F-signal module failure, communications failure, program execution error).

To achieve this, a variety of monitoring times have been implemented to ensure that the affected functions are brought to a safe state if this time is exceeded.

# What is the purpose of monitoring times and system response times?

For the S7-400 F/FH, there are essentially two different types of monitoring/error response:

- If the monitoring times of the fail-safe program are exceeded, the affected F-program switches off and the inputs/outputs of the F-signal modules are passivated.
- If the monitoring time for PROFIsafe communication between the F CPU and F signal modules is exceeded, the inputs/outputs of the affected F signal modules are passivated and the corresponding substitute values are forwarded to the CPU.

Both the availability and the safety of the F/FH system must be taken into account when configuring monitoring times.

- Availability: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently high to prevent time monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present.
- Safety: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently low to prevent the process safety time from being exceeded.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

The rule of thumb is that a non-redundant S7 F/FH system supports shorter monitoring times and, therefore, shorter response times in the event of an error. For a redundant system, longer monitoring times have to be configured to allow for switchover of the components (PROFIBUS, interface modules) and the coupling/updating of the H-CPU.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

Note

You can find additional information about the Secure Write Command in the manual ""SIMATIC Industrial software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/101509838).

For more information on the structure of the ""@PCS7Tyicals.CFG"" file, refer to the WinCC Information System (Start > Simatic > WinCC > WinCC Information System in contents under Options > Options for Process Control > Graphic Object Update Wizard > Structure of the Configuration File).

# Use of an additional enable (for example, key switch)

During an operation, input EN_SWC must be 1 on the F_SWC_P F block. To ensure that operations can only be performed in certain process states or after enabling, connect the EN_SWC input to the input signal of a key switch or connect it to a logic. If input EN_SWC = 0, all existing bypasses are disabled. However, the configured substitute values are retained.

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

A fail-safe system must switch the process to a safe state within a defined response time in the event of a system error (e.g. CPU failure, F-signal module failure, communications failure, program execution error).

To achieve this, a variety of monitoring times have been implemented to ensure that the affected functions are brought to a safe state if this time is exceeded.

# What is the purpose of monitoring times and system response times?

For the S7-400 F/FH, there are essentially two different types of monitoring/error response:

- If the monitoring times of the fail-safe program are exceeded, the affected F-program switches off and the inputs/outputs of the F-signal modules are passivated.
- If the monitoring time for PROFIsafe communication between the F CPU and F signal modules is exceeded, the inputs/outputs of the affected F signal modules are passivated and the corresponding substitute values are forwarded to the CPU.

Both the availability and the safety of the F/FH system must be taken into account when configuring monitoring times.

- Availability: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently high to prevent time monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present.
- Safety: The monitoring times must be set sufficiently low to prevent the process safety time from being exceeded.

Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0) Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

The rule of thumb is that a non-redundant S7 F/FH system supports shorter monitoring times and, therefore, shorter response times in the event of an error. For a redundant system, longer monitoring times have to be configured to allow for switchover of the components (PROFIBUS, interface modules) and the coupling/updating of the H-CPU.

# Calculation

An Excel file is used for the monitoring and reaction times calculated below. You can find this file on the Internet by pointing your browser to the following link: https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22557362

The Excel file consists of the following sheets:

Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Preface

# Subject of the manual

As a distinctly open system, SIMATIC PCS 7 can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of customer needs. The system software provides the project engineer with a great deal of freedom in terms of project configuration, as well as in the design of the program and visualization.

Experience has shown that subsequent modernization or plant expansion work is made much easier if the project is configured ""in conformance with PCS 7"" as far as possible right from the start. This means users must adhere to certain basic rules to ensure that the provided system functions will offer optimum usability in the future.

This manual serves as a compendium in addition to the product documentation for SIMATIC PCS 7. The basic tasks for creating and configuring the project are described in the form of instructions with numerous illustrations.

The compendium is divided into the following parts:

- Configuration guidelines including checklist
- Process safety including two checklists
- Technical functions with SFC types
- Operation and maintenance including checklist
- Hardware installation including checklist
- Industrial Security

# Subject of Part B - Process safety

This compendium directly reflects the recommended method for configuration and corresponds to the procedure described in the documentation for S7 F/FH Systems, whereby numerous practical experiences were evaluated. The description relates to working with the project and the parameter settings of the components it contains but not the application itself.

Compendium Part B is dedicated to the implementation of the fail-safe part of an S7 program.

It examines the following F-software components:

- S7 F-Systems
- SIMATIC Safety Matrix

Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)

Operating Manual, 04/2018, A5E43228905-AA

# Preface

# Subject of the manual

As a distinctly open system, SIMATIC PCS 7 can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of customer needs. The system software provides the project engineer with a great deal of freedom in terms of project configuration, as well as in the design of the program and visualization.

Experience has shown that subsequent modernization or plant expansion work is made much easier if the project is configured ""in conformance with PCS 7"" as far as possible right from the start. This means users must adhere to certain basic rules to ensure that the provided system functions will offer optimum usability in the future.

This manual serves as a compendium in addition to the product documentation for SIMATIC PCS 7. The basic tasks for creating and configuring the project are described in the form of instructions with numerous illustrations.

The compendium is divided into the following parts:

- Configuration guidelines including checklist
- Process safety including two checklists
- Technical functions with SFC types
- Operation and maintenance including checklist
- Hardware installation including checklist
- Industrial Security

# Subject of Part B - Process safety

This compendium directly reflects the recommended method for configuration and corresponds to the procedure described in the documentation for S7 F/FH Systems, whereby numerous practical experiences were evaluated. The description relates to working with the project and the parameter settings of the components it contains but not the application itself.

Compendium Part B is dedicated to the implementation of the fail-safe part of an S7 program.

It examines the following F-software components:

- S7 F-Systems
- SIMATIC Safety Matrix

When there is a cycle overload in the CPU, the time intervals between two calls of the interrupt OBs are increased (the number of calls are reduced). In the safety program, this may cause I/O modules to be passivated or an F-STOP to be triggered, depending on the setting of the subsequently calculated monitoring times. To avoid this, the cyclic interrupt OB with security program must be disabled to reduce the calls. To do this, set the OBxx_ATT input (xx = no. of the cyclic interrupt OB with safety program) at the CPU_RT block to ""0"".

A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC78, the performance data can be read via ""CPU_RT"". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 Asset Management.

The first time the F-program is compiled, you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) which may elapse between two calls to this cyclic interrupt OB. The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3000 ms.

Should this default value not be suitable for your process, you can modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block (located in the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart).

You will need the following parameters for an exact calculation of the scan cycle monitoring time for a cyclic interrupt OB:

- TP15: Configured ""max.

# Procedure

The first time the F-program is compiled, you will be prompted to enter a value for the maximum cycle time (MAX_CYC) which may elapse between two calls to this cyclic interrupt OB. The default for the maximum F-cycle time is 3000 ms.

Should this default value not be suitable for your process, you can modify it directly at the F_CYC_CO block (located in the automatically generated @F_CycCo-OB3x chart).

You will need the following parameters for an exact calculation of the scan cycle monitoring time for a cyclic interrupt OB:

- TP15: Configured ""max. ",What is the significance of the OBxx_ATT input in the 'CPU_RT' block?,A1,The OBxx_ATT input controls whether the cyclic interrupt OB with the safety program is enabled ('1') or disabled ('0').,2.5625,2.84375,3.765625,1.7265625,0.484375,2.4992187500000003,Y

To prevent monitoring from being triggered when no errors are present, MAX_CYC must be set higher than the TCImax calculated for the corresponding cyclic interrupt OB.

- For non-redundant S7 F/FH systems:
- The setting for TCImax must be at least as high as the configured execution time (TCI) of the cyclic interrupt OB.
- For redundant S7 F/FH systems:
- A priority > 15 is used in the S7 F/FH-system for cyclic interrupt OBs with a safety program. The maximum disabling time for priority classes > 15 (TP15) must also be taken into account for updating here.

You can find the value for TCI in the ""Execution"" column of the relevant cyclic interrupt OB, located on the ""Cyclic Interrupts"" tab in the CPU properties.

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

# 7.11.3 Communication monitoring time for F CPU/F signal modules

Time monitoring of PROFIsafe or PROFINET communication is implemented in the F-signal modules and in the F-CPU using F-module drivers. The value is entered while assigning parameters for the F-signal modules in HW Config (""F_monitoring time"" parameter) and applied automatically when the F-module drivers are generated.

|source address|CPU 410-5H|
|target_address|1021|
|DIP switch setting to o)|111101 PSTO|
|monitoring time (ms)|2500|

To prevent either monitoring in the F-module driver or monitoring in the F-signal module from being triggered when no errors are present, the F-monitoring time TPSTO must be set to a sufficiently high value. The lowest possible F monitoring time can be determined with S7tftime.xlsm.

# Configuring the PROFIsafe monitoring time

S7ftime.xlsm distinguishes 7 possibilities depending on the hardware configuration:

- Version 1: Single-channel F I/Os via PROFIBUS-DP or PROFINET IO
- Version 2: Single-channel switched F I/Os or redundantly switched F I/Os via PROFIBUS-DP or PROFINET IO
- Variant 3: Single-channel F PA field device via DP/PA coupler
- Variant 4: Single channel F PA device via DP/PA Link
- Variant 5: Single-channel switched F PA device via DP/PA Link

# Configuring the safety program

# 7.11 Monitoring times and system response times

The F-monitoring time must be calculated for the relevant variant of each F-signal module type or each device, and the values for the cyclic interrupt OB must be calculated as well. To do this, select the appropriate configuration variant and enter the parameters in the corresponding line.

|PROFIBUS-DP|300 mS|500 ms|E0 ms|25 ms|20 Ms|
|PROFINETIO| |Joo Ms|Ic0m|30 m| |

You need the following parameters for the calculation depending on the variant:

- TCI: Configured execution time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F-module driver is processed
- TPROG: Program runtime of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F-module driver is processed
- TCImax: Time set at the F_CYC_CO block for scan cycle monitoring of the cyclic interrupt OB
- TDP_DLY: Additional delay time with external DP interface (via CP 443-5 Extended)
- TTR/TR1: Maximum target rotation time for the DP master system
- TTR2: Maximum target rotation time for the subordinate DP master system on the Y link, or maximum target rotation time for the subordinate PA master system on the DP/PA coupler
- TDPPA_L_DLY: Delay time with a DP/PA link
- TY_L_DLY: Delay time with a Y link
- TSlave: Maximum delay time with IM 153-2 / IM 153-4 (typical value for ET 200M = 1 ms)
- TDAT: Maximum acknowledgment time of the fail-safe I/O module in safety mode (F signal module group data sheet)

Introduction

Time monitoring of fail-safe communication between 2 F-CPUs is implemented in the send and receive blocks F_SENDR and F_RCVR or F_SENDBO and F_RCVBO with the same TIMEOUT monitoring time, which needs to be configured on both the send and receive blocks. The lowest value for the timeout can be determined using S7ftime.xlsm.

You will need the following parameters to calculate the ""TIMEOUT"" parameter:

Communication between F-CPUs (TIMEOUT parameter)

CPU 1, sender

- TCI1: Configured cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the send blocks F_SENDBO or F_SENDR are called.
- TDelay1, F_SEND: Maximum communication delay when updating the standby in the S7 FH system with call of F_SENDBO or F_SENDR. Only relevant for redundant S7 FH systems. Enter a 0 if you are not using an S7 FH system.
- TCiR1: CiR synchronization time. Enter 0 if you do not use CiR.
- TCiRmax1: Upper limit of the CiR synchronization time (default setting: 1s). Enter 0 if you do not use CiR.

CPU 2, recipient

- TCiRmax2: Upper limit of the CiR synchronization time (default setting: 1s). Enter 0 if you do not use CiR.
- TCiR2: CiR synchronization time. Enter 0 if you do not use CiR.
- TDelay2, F-Rec: Maximum communication delay when updating the standby in the FH system with call of F_RCVBO or F_RCVR. Only relevant for redundant S7 FH systems. Enter 0 if you are not using an S7 FH-system.
- TCI2: Configured cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the receive blocks F_RCVBO or F_RCVR are called.

With the exception of the TDelay1/Delay2 parameters, all the parameters are described in Section Monitoring times and system response times (Page 137).

# 7.11.4 Monitoring time for safety-related communication between F-CPUs

Introduction

Time monitoring of fail-safe communication between 2 F-CPUs is implemented in the send and receive blocks F_SENDR and F_RCVR or F_SENDBO and F_RCVBO with the same TIMEOUT monitoring time, which needs to be configured on both the send and receive blocks. The lowest value for the timeout can be determined using S7ftime.xlsm.

- TCiR1: CiR synchronization time. Enter 0 if you do not use CiR.
- TCiRmax1: Upper limit of the CiR synchronization time (default setting: 1s). Enter 0 if you do not use CiR.

CPU 2, recipient

- TCiRmax2: Upper limit of the CiR synchronization time (default setting: 1s). Enter 0 if you do not use CiR.
- TCiR2: CiR synchronization time. Enter 0 if you do not use CiR.

Time monitoring is implemented in the F_R_BO or F_R_RF FBs and configured at the ""TIMEOUT"" input parameter of the receive block.

To prevent time monitoring being triggered when no errors are pending, the TIMEOUT monitoring time must be set to a value which is at least equal to the higher of the two maximum cyclic interrupt cycle times of F_S_R or F_S_BO and F_R_R or F_R_BO. The lowest value for the timeout can be determined using S7ftime.xls.

# 7.11.6 Response times of safety functions

# Definition of response time

The response time is the time between the detection of an input signal and the changing of a linked output signal.

The actual response time is always between a minimum and a maximum response time. When configuring your plant, you must always assume the maximum response time.

The maximum response time of a safety function must be shorter than the process safety time.

# Definition of process safety time

The process safety time is the time within which the process can be left to its own devices without creating a dangerous situation.

Within the process safety time, the S7 F/FH system controlling the process is not under control; in other words, it might malfunction or fail completely. The process safety time depends on the type of process and must be specified individually.

- 2) Response time dependent on the sensor supply test parameter:
- - • Deactivated: For the times within the bracket terms zero values are to be inserted
- • Activated: For the times within the bracket terms the values from assigned parameters are to be inserted

3) Response time is based on the sensor supply parameter at 1oo2 (2v2):

Example calculation of the response time of EM 8 F-DI Ex NAMUR:

- Parameter assignment:
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation (equivalent or non-equivalent)
- Discrepancy behavior: Provide last valid value
- Discrepancy time: 400 ms
- Sensor supply at 1oo2 (2v2): Sensor n and n+4 to Vs n
- Input delay: 3 ms
- Sensor supply test: Activated
- Time for sensor test: 10 ms
- Start-up time of the sensor after sensor test: 100 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))
- Result: Response time = 48 ms + 3 ms + 400 ms + (10 ms + 100 ms) + (0) = 561 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + 2 x {(time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))}
- Result: Response time = 48 ms + 3 ms + 400 ms + 2x{(10 ms + 100 ms) + (0)} = 671 ms

# Explanations:

- 1) Internal processing time dependent on parameter assignment – see above table ""Internal processing time of the EM 8 F-DI Ex NAMUR based on parameter assignment""
- 2) Response time dependent on the sensor supply test parameter:
- - • Deactivated: For the times within the bracket terms zero values are to be inserted
- • Activated: For the times within the bracket terms the values from assigned parameters are to be inserted

3) Response time is based on the sensor supply parameter at 1oo2 (2v2):

Example calculation of the response time of EM 8 F-DI Ex NAMUR:

- Parameter assignment:
- 1oo2 (2v2) evaluation (equivalent or non-equivalent)
- Discrepancy behavior: Provide last valid value
- Discrepancy time: 400 ms
- Sensor supply at 1oo2 (2v2): Sensor n and n+4 to Vs n
- Input delay: 3 ms
- Sensor supply test: Activated
- Time for sensor test: 10 ms
- Start-up time of the sensor after sensor test: 100 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))
- Result: Response time = 48 ms + 3 ms + 400 ms + (10 ms + 100 ms) + (0) = 561 ms
- Response time = Internal processing time + input delay + discrepancy time + 2 x {(time for sensor testCHANNEL(n) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n)) + (time for sensor testCHANNEL(n+4) + start-up time of the sensor after sensor testCHANNEL(n+4))}
- Result: Response time = 48 ms + 3 ms + 400 ms + 2x{(10 ms + 100 ms) + (0)} = 671 ms

There are 2 different variants:

- One F-shutdown group is present in the signal flow being examined.
- Two F-shutdown groups are present in the signal flow being examined.

You will need the following parameters for the calculation:

|TCI/TCI1/TCI2|Configured cycle time of the cyclic interrupt OB in which the F-function block has been installed in each case|
|---|---|
|TCImax.proj. / TCImax.proj.1 / TCImax.proj.2|Time set in chart @F_CycCo-OBxx, at input MAX_CYC of the F_CYC_CO-OBxx F-function block (xx = Number of corresponding cyclic interrupt OB).|
|TFPROG/TFPROG1/TFPROG2|Program runtime of the corresponding cyclic interrupt OB|
|TIMEOUT|Time parameterized at the TIMEOUT input of the F_R_BO or F_R_R block|

# CPU-to-CPU communication (optional)

If your signal is transferred from one CPU to another, select ""Yes"" in the header. For calculation purposes, you require the time parameterized at the TIMEOUT input of the send and receive blocks for communication.

If CPU-to-CPU communication is not taking place, leave the default setting (""No"") unchanged. The next section, ""Processing in the 2nd CPU"", will not be taken into account during calculation in this case.

Operator input

The operation of the Safety Matrix must be enabled in the CFC by a ""1"" signal at the EN_SWC input. This can be done by logic or interconnection to the input channel driver of a key switch. The F-password is also requested in an online mode of the ES. The operator permissions configured in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool are required for the operation of an OS. If password prompting and operator authorization are adequate for access protection, you can set the EN_SWC input in the Safety Matrix block permanently to ""1"" with an interconnection to the output of an F_NOT block.

Operator input

The operation of the Safety Matrix must be enabled in the CFC by a ""1"" signal at the EN_SWC input. This can be done by logic or interconnection to the input channel driver of a key switch. The F-password is also requested in an online mode of the ES. The operator permissions configured in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool are required for the operation of an OS. If password prompting and operator authorization are adequate for access protection, you can set the EN_SWC input in the Safety Matrix block permanently to ""1"" with an interconnection to the output of an F_NOT block.

# 8.3 Organizing matrices into different shutdown groups

The information below is intended to demonstrate how two matrices located in different shutdown groups but the same OB are installed. The implementation is made with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2.

# Creating shutdown groups

The F-module driver of an F-signal module may only be assigned to one shutdown group. Therefore, when creating shutdown groups you must make sure that all signals in an F-signal module are used in the same shutdown group. The use of signals in an F-signal module in different shutdown groups results in errors during compiling due to invalid interconnections.

In the example below, the intention is to have two matrices be executed with a matrix cycle time of 300 ms, but in separate shutdown groups.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.3 Organizing matrices into different shutdown groups

Inserting a new matrix in a new shutdown group.

To insert a new matrix and assign it to a new shutdown group, proceed as outlined below.

1. Create a new matrix and, in the Safety Matrix engineering tool, for the matrix cycle time select a cyclic interrupt OB that is not in use and into which no matrices have yet been inserted.
2. Create your safety function and transfer the matrix. In the cyclic interrupt OB, three runtime groups will be created for this matrix.
3. Move all three runtime groups to the destination cyclic interrupt OB (in this case, cyclic interrupt OB 37) and placing them before the first runtime group of the safety program.

In order to transfer any changes that may be made in the Safety Matrix engineering tool to the correct runtime/shutdown group as well, you will then need to set the matrix cycle time to the current value, which in this case is 300 ms (OB 37).
Transfer the matrix with the modified cyclic interrupt OB setting to the project. When changes are transferred, the engineering tool will locate the runtime group that has been created and moved, and transfer changes to it as well. The following information appears briefly in the status bar of the Safety Matrix engineering tool: The Matrix Runtime Group has been renamed (SafetyMatrix36) [This may be changed during transfer]

Note: Please note that if the matrix CFC shutdown groups are subsequently moved or the safety program is subsequently divided into shutdown groups, the amount of additional effort may be considerable in terms of the change configuration work involved.

# 8.5 User authorizations for the Safety Matrix Viewer

In the properties of the Safety Matrix in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool, you can set up a separate user authorization for each action and assign it to selected users. In addition to the ""Initiator"" and/or ""Confirmer"" authorization, users must have the specified authorization level for the respective operator function to be executed. In the example configuration shown below, there is a ""User"" who has ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) rights. In addition to the ""Initiator"", it has the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-level process control"" (authorization level 6).

To confirm a transaction (4-eyes principle), a ""user"" is required who has ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights. In addition to ""Confirmer"", the ""User"" must be assigned the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-order process control"" (authorization level 6).

If a ""User"" is to initiate and confirm a specific action (acknowledgment driver), this action must be assigned its own user level and the ""User"" must have ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) and ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.3 Organizing matrices into different shutdown groups

Inserting a new matrix in a new shutdown group.

To insert a new matrix and assign it to a new shutdown group, proceed as outlined below.

1. Create a new matrix and, in the Safety Matrix engineering tool, for the matrix cycle time select a cyclic interrupt OB that is not in use and into which no matrices have yet been inserted.
2. Create your safety function and transfer the matrix. In the cyclic interrupt OB, three runtime groups will be created for this matrix.
3. Move all three runtime groups to the destination cyclic interrupt OB (in this case, cyclic interrupt OB 37) and placing them before the first runtime group of the safety program.

In order to transfer any changes that may be made in the Safety Matrix engineering tool to the correct runtime/shutdown group as well, you will then need to set the matrix cycle time to the current value, which in this case is 300 ms (OB 37).
Transfer the matrix with the modified cyclic interrupt OB setting to the project. When changes are transferred, the engineering tool will locate the runtime group that has been created and moved, and transfer changes to it as well. The following information appears briefly in the status bar of the Safety Matrix engineering tool: The Matrix Runtime Group has been renamed (SafetyMatrix36) [This may be changed during transfer]

Note: Please note that if the matrix CFC shutdown groups are subsequently moved or the safety program is subsequently divided into shutdown groups, the amount of additional effort may be considerable in terms of the change configuration work involved. For this reason, you must make sure that division into shutdown groups takes place at the start of configuration and that the F-signal modules are assigned to shutdown groups.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.3 Organizing matrices into different shutdown groups

Inserting a new matrix in a new shutdown group.

To insert a new matrix and assign it to a new shutdown group, proceed as outlined below.

1. Create a new matrix and, in the Safety Matrix engineering tool, for the matrix cycle time select a cyclic interrupt OB that is not in use and into which no matrices have yet been inserted.
2. Create your safety function and transfer the matrix. In the cyclic interrupt OB, three runtime groups will be created for this matrix.
3. Move all three runtime groups to the destination cyclic interrupt OB (in this case, cyclic interrupt OB 37) and placing them before the first runtime group of the safety program.

In order to transfer any changes that may be made in the Safety Matrix engineering tool to the correct runtime/shutdown group as well, you will then need to set the matrix cycle time to the current value, which in this case is 300 ms (OB 37).
Transfer the matrix with the modified cyclic interrupt OB setting to the project. When changes are transferred, the engineering tool will locate the runtime group that has been created and moved, and transfer changes to it as well. The following information appears briefly in the status bar of the Safety Matrix engineering tool: The Matrix Runtime Group has been renamed (SafetyMatrix36) [This may be changed during transfer]

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.5 User authorizations for the Safety Matrix Viewer

In the properties of the Safety Matrix in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool, you can set up a separate user authorization for each action and assign it to selected users. In addition to the ""Initiator"" and/or ""Confirmer"" authorization, users must have the specified authorization level for the respective operator function to be executed. In the example configuration shown below, there is a ""User"" who has ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) rights. In addition to the ""Initiator"", it has the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-level process control"" (authorization level 6).

To confirm a transaction (4-eyes principle), a ""user"" is required who has ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights. In addition to ""Confirmer"", the ""User"" must be assigned the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-order process control"" (authorization level 6).

If a ""User"" is to initiate and confirm a specific action (acknowledgment driver), this action must be assigned its own user level and the ""User"" must have ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) and ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.6 Interconnections between the matrix and safety program

When establishing interconnections between the matrix and the remainder of the safety program, you must ensure that the interconnected blocks are all in the same shutdown group, or that the right communication blocks have been installed between the shutdown groups.

# 8.7 Using imported F channel drivers in the matrix

There is a difference between internal and external F-channel drivers in the Safety Matrix. ",How do you insert a new matrix into a new shutdown group according to the 'Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)'?,A5,"For a new matrix in a new shutdown group, pick an unused cyclic interrupt OB, compile the matrix, and arrange its runtime groups within the chosen OB.",1.15625,1.2109375,3.203125,1.421875,0.416015625,1.4513671875,Y

In order to ensure that as much information as possible is retained in this printout, activate all options on the ""General"" tab prior to printing (accessible via ""View > Adapt > Layout""); otherwise, fields that are not visible will not be printed. Please note that this type of printout does not meet the criteria of an acceptance document, as it lacks key information such as a signature and cyclic interrupt OB.

# 8.3 Organizing matrices into different shutdown groups

The information below is intended to demonstrate how two matrices located in different shutdown groups but the same OB are installed. The implementation is made with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2.

# Creating shutdown groups

The F-module driver of an F-signal module may only be assigned to one shutdown group. Therefore, when creating shutdown groups you must make sure that all signals in an F-signal module are used in the same shutdown group. The use of signals in an F-signal module in different shutdown groups results in errors during compiling due to invalid interconnections.

In the example below, the intention is to have two matrices be executed with a matrix cycle time of 300 ms, but in separate shutdown groups.

In the properties of the Safety Matrix in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool, you can set up a separate user authorization for each action and assign it to selected users. In addition to the ""Initiator"" and/or ""Confirmer"" authorization, users must have the specified authorization level for the respective operator function to be executed. In the example configuration shown below, there is a ""User"" who has ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) rights. In addition to the ""Initiator"", it has the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-level process control"" (authorization level 6).

To confirm a transaction (4-eyes principle), a ""user"" is required who has ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights. In addition to ""Confirmer"", the ""User"" must be assigned the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-order process control"" (authorization level 6).

If a ""User"" is to initiate and confirm a specific action (acknowledgment driver), this action must be assigned its own user level and the ""User"" must have ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) and ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights.

# 8.6 Interconnections between the matrix and safety program

When establishing interconnections between the matrix and the remainder of the safety program, you must ensure that the interconnected blocks are all in the same shutdown group, or that the right communication blocks have been installed between the shutdown groups.

# 8.7 Using imported F channel drivers in the matrix

There is a difference between internal and external F-channel drivers in the Safety Matrix. ",What additional runtime groups does the compiler create when compiling the S7 program in the 'Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)'?,A5,"For each new shutdown group, the compiler produces @F_IN_<OBNr>_xx and @F_OUT_<OBNr>_xx runtime groups during S7 program compilation.",2.015625,2.34375,3.53125,1.78125,0.62109375,2.130078125,Y

In order to ensure that as much information as possible is retained in this printout, activate all options on the ""General"" tab prior to printing (accessible via ""View > Adapt > Layout""); otherwise, fields that are not visible will not be printed. Please note that this type of printout does not meet the criteria of an acceptance document, as it lacks key information such as a signature and cyclic interrupt OB.

# 8.3 Organizing matrices into different shutdown groups

The information below is intended to demonstrate how two matrices located in different shutdown groups but the same OB are installed. The implementation is made with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2.

# Creating shutdown groups

The F-module driver of an F-signal module may only be assigned to one shutdown group. Therefore, when creating shutdown groups you must make sure that all signals in an F-signal module are used in the same shutdown group. The use of signals in an F-signal module in different shutdown groups results in errors during compiling due to invalid interconnections.

In the example below, the intention is to have two matrices be executed with a matrix cycle time of 300 ms, but in separate shutdown groups.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.3 Organizing matrices into different shutdown groups

Inserting a new matrix in a new shutdown group.

To insert a new matrix and assign it to a new shutdown group, proceed as outlined below.

1. Create a new matrix and, in the Safety Matrix engineering tool, for the matrix cycle time select a cyclic interrupt OB that is not in use and into which no matrices have yet been inserted.
2. Create your safety function and transfer the matrix. In the cyclic interrupt OB, three runtime groups will be created for this matrix.
3. Move all three runtime groups to the destination cyclic interrupt OB (in this case, cyclic interrupt OB 37) and placing them before the first runtime group of the safety program.

In order to transfer any changes that may be made in the Safety Matrix engineering tool to the correct runtime/shutdown group as well, you will then need to set the matrix cycle time to the current value, which in this case is 300 ms (OB 37).
Transfer the matrix with the modified cyclic interrupt OB setting to the project. When changes are transferred, the engineering tool will locate the runtime group that has been created and moved, and transfer changes to it as well. The following information appears briefly in the status bar of the Safety Matrix engineering tool: The Matrix Runtime Group has been renamed (SafetyMatrix36) [This may be changed during transfer]

Note: Please note that if the matrix CFC shutdown groups are subsequently moved or the safety program is subsequently divided into shutdown groups, the amount of additional effort may be considerable in terms of the change configuration work involved. For this reason, you must make sure that division into shutdown groups takes place at the start of configuration and that the F-signal modules are assigned to shutdown groups.

# Creating shutdown groups

The F-module driver of an F-signal module may only be assigned to one shutdown group. Therefore, when creating shutdown groups you must make sure that all signals in an F-signal module are used in the same shutdown group. The use of signals in an F-signal module in different shutdown groups results in errors during compiling due to invalid interconnections.

In the example below, the intention is to have two matrices be executed with a matrix cycle time of 300 ms, but in separate shutdown groups.

Inserting a new matrix in a new shutdown group.

To insert a new matrix and assign it to a new shutdown group, proceed as outlined below.

1. Create a new matrix and, in the Safety Matrix engineering tool, for the matrix cycle time select a cyclic interrupt OB that is not in use and into which no matrices have yet been inserted.
2. Create your safety function and transfer the matrix. In the cyclic interrupt OB, three runtime groups will be created for this matrix.
3. Move all three runtime groups to the destination cyclic interrupt OB (in this case, cyclic interrupt OB 37) and placing them before the first runtime group of the safety program.

In order to transfer any changes that may be made in the Safety Matrix engineering tool to the correct runtime/shutdown group as well, you will then need to set the matrix cycle time to the current value, which in this case is 300 ms (OB 37).
Transfer the matrix with the modified cyclic interrupt OB setting to the project. When changes are transferred, the engineering tool will locate the runtime group that has been created and moved, and transfer changes to it as well. The following information appears briefly in the status bar of the Safety Matrix engineering tool: The Matrix Runtime Group has been renamed (SafetyMatrix36) [This may be changed during transfer]

Note: Please note that if the matrix CFC shutdown groups are subsequently moved or the safety program is subsequently divided into shutdown groups, the amount of additional effort may be considerable in terms of the change configuration work involved. For this reason, you must make sure that division into shutdown groups takes place at the start of configuration and that the F-signal modules are assigned to shutdown groups.

In the properties of the Safety Matrix in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool, you can set up a separate user authorization for each action and assign it to selected users. In addition to the ""Initiator"" and/or ""Confirmer"" authorization, users must have the specified authorization level for the respective operator function to be executed. In the example configuration shown below, there is a ""User"" who has ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) rights. In addition to the ""Initiator"", it has the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-level process control"" (authorization level 6).

To confirm a transaction (4-eyes principle), a ""user"" is required who has ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights. In addition to ""Confirmer"", the ""User"" must be assigned the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-order process control"" (authorization level 6).

If a ""User"" is to initiate and confirm a specific action (acknowledgment driver), this action must be assigned its own user level and the ""User"" must have ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) and ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights.

When changes are transferred, the engineering tool will locate the runtime group that has been created and moved, and transfer changes to it as well. The following information appears briefly in the status bar of the Safety Matrix engineering tool: The Matrix Runtime Group has been renamed (SafetyMatrix36) [This may be changed during transfer]

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.5 User authorizations for the Safety Matrix Viewer

In the properties of the Safety Matrix in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool, you can set up a separate user authorization for each action and assign it to selected users. In addition to the ""Initiator"" and/or ""Confirmer"" authorization, users must have the specified authorization level for the respective operator function to be executed. In the example configuration shown below, there is a ""User"" who has ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) rights. In addition to the ""Initiator"", it has the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-level process control"" (authorization level 6).

To confirm a transaction (4-eyes principle), a ""user"" is required who has ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights. In addition to ""Confirmer"", the ""User"" must be assigned the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-order process control"" (authorization level 6).

If a ""User"" is to initiate and confirm a specific action (acknowledgment driver), this action must be assigned its own user level and the ""User"" must have ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) and ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.6 Interconnections between the matrix and safety program

When establishing interconnections between the matrix and the remainder of the safety program, you must ensure that the interconnected blocks are all in the same shutdown group, or that the right communication blocks have been installed between the shutdown groups.

# 8.7 Using imported F channel drivers in the matrix

There is a difference between internal and external F-channel drivers in the Safety Matrix. ",What is the significance of the F_PSG_M block in the 'Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)'?,A1,The F_PSG_M block is placed at the end of a new matrix runtime group to create the required shutdown group.,1.3828125,1.625,3.359375,1.65625,0.1884765625,1.72099609375,Y

In order to ensure that as much information as possible is retained in this printout, activate all options on the ""General"" tab prior to printing (accessible via ""View > Adapt > Layout""); otherwise, fields that are not visible will not be printed. Please note that this type of printout does not meet the criteria of an acceptance document, as it lacks key information such as a signature and cyclic interrupt OB.

# 8.3 Organizing matrices into different shutdown groups

The information below is intended to demonstrate how two matrices located in different shutdown groups but the same OB are installed. The implementation is made with S7 F Systems Lib V1_3 SP2.

# Creating shutdown groups

The F-module driver of an F-signal module may only be assigned to one shutdown group. Therefore, when creating shutdown groups you must make sure that all signals in an F-signal module are used in the same shutdown group. The use of signals in an F-signal module in different shutdown groups results in errors during compiling due to invalid interconnections.

In the example below, the intention is to have two matrices be executed with a matrix cycle time of 300 ms, but in separate shutdown groups.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.3 Organizing matrices into different shutdown groups

Inserting a new matrix in a new shutdown group.

To insert a new matrix and assign it to a new shutdown group, proceed as outlined below.

1. Create a new matrix and, in the Safety Matrix engineering tool, for the matrix cycle time select a cyclic interrupt OB that is not in use and into which no matrices have yet been inserted.
2. Create your safety function and transfer the matrix. In the cyclic interrupt OB, three runtime groups will be created for this matrix.
3. Move all three runtime groups to the destination cyclic interrupt OB (in this case, cyclic interrupt OB 37) and placing them before the first runtime group of the safety program.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.5 User authorizations for the Safety Matrix Viewer

In the properties of the Safety Matrix in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool, you can set up a separate user authorization for each action and assign it to selected users. In addition to the ""Initiator"" and/or ""Confirmer"" authorization, users must have the specified authorization level for the respective operator function to be executed. In the example configuration shown below, there is a ""User"" who has ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) rights. In addition to the ""Initiator"", it has the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-level process control"" (authorization level 6).

To confirm a transaction (4-eyes principle), a ""user"" is required who has ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights. In addition to ""Confirmer"", the ""User"" must be assigned the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-order process control"" (authorization level 6).

If a ""User"" is to initiate and confirm a specific action (acknowledgment driver), this action must be assigned its own user level and the ""User"" must have ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) and ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.3 Organizing matrices into different shutdown groups

Inserting a new matrix in a new shutdown group.

To insert a new matrix and assign it to a new shutdown group, proceed as outlined below.

1. Create a new matrix and, in the Safety Matrix engineering tool, for the matrix cycle time select a cyclic interrupt OB that is not in use and into which no matrices have yet been inserted.
2. Create your safety function and transfer the matrix. In the cyclic interrupt OB, three runtime groups will be created for this matrix.
3. Move all three runtime groups to the destination cyclic interrupt OB (in this case, cyclic interrupt OB 37) and placing them before the first runtime group of the safety program.

In order to transfer any changes that may be made in the Safety Matrix engineering tool to the correct runtime/shutdown group as well, you will then need to set the matrix cycle time to the current value, which in this case is 300 ms (OB 37).
Transfer the matrix with the modified cyclic interrupt OB setting to the project. When changes are transferred, the engineering tool will locate the runtime group that has been created and moved, and transfer changes to it as well. The following information appears briefly in the status bar of the Safety Matrix engineering tool: The Matrix Runtime Group has been renamed (SafetyMatrix36) [This may be changed during transfer]

Note: Please note that if the matrix CFC shutdown groups are subsequently moved or the safety program is subsequently divided into shutdown groups, the amount of additional effort may be considerable in terms of the change configuration work involved. For this reason, you must make sure that division into shutdown groups takes place at the start of configuration and that the F-signal modules are assigned to shutdown groups.

In order to transfer any changes that may be made in the Safety Matrix engineering tool to the correct runtime/shutdown group as well, you will then need to set the matrix cycle time to the current value, which in this case is 300 ms (OB 37).
Transfer the matrix with the modified cyclic interrupt OB setting to the project. When changes are transferred, the engineering tool will locate the runtime group that has been created and moved, and transfer changes to it as well. The following information appears briefly in the status bar of the Safety Matrix engineering tool: The Matrix Runtime Group has been renamed (SafetyMatrix36) [This may be changed during transfer]

Note: Please note that if the matrix CFC shutdown groups are subsequently moved or the safety program is subsequently divided into shutdown groups, the amount of additional effort may be considerable in terms of the change configuration work involved. For this reason, you must make sure that division into shutdown groups takes place at the start of configuration and that the F-signal modules are assigned to shutdown groups.

# 8.5 User authorizations for the Safety Matrix Viewer

In the properties of the Safety Matrix in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool, you can set up a separate user authorization for each action and assign it to selected users. In addition to the ""Initiator"" and/or ""Confirmer"" authorization, users must have the specified authorization level for the respective operator function to be executed. In the example configuration shown below, there is a ""User"" who has ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) rights. In addition to the ""Initiator"", it has the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-level process control"" (authorization level 6).

To confirm a transaction (4-eyes principle), a ""user"" is required who has ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights. In addition to ""Confirmer"", the ""User"" must be assigned the ""Process control"" authorization (authorization level 5) and the ""Higher-order process control"" (authorization level 6).

If a ""User"" is to initiate and confirm a specific action (acknowledgment driver), this action must be assigned its own user level and the ""User"" must have ""Initiator"" (authorization level 100) and ""Confirmer"" (authorization level 101) rights.

# Configuration with Safety Matrix

# 8.6 Interconnections between the matrix and safety program

When establishing interconnections between the matrix and the remainder of the safety program, you must ensure that the interconnected blocks are all in the same shutdown group, or that the right communication blocks have been installed between the shutdown groups.

# 8.7 Using imported F channel drivers in the matrix

There is a difference between internal and external F-channel drivers in the Safety Matrix. ",Why is it important to divide into shutdown groups at the start of configuration in the 'Compendium Part B - Process Safety (V9.0)'?,A1,Early division into shutdown groups minimizes extensive reconfiguration work later by ensuring F-signal modules are correctly assigned from the beginning.,2.296875,2.1875,3.46875,1.359375,0.42578125,2.132421875,Y

Internal F-channel drivers are recreated whenever any changes affecting the ""chart and parameters"" are made, whereby any interconnections previously established are lost and changed parameters to the inputs of the F-channel drivers are overwritten with the default values. This is why you are not allowed to change parameters or perform interconnections in this driver chart.

The operation of the safety matrix must be enabled in the CFC by a ""1"" signal at the EN_SWC input. This can be done by logic or interconnection to the input channel driver of a key switch. The F-password is also requested in an online mode of the ES. The operator permissions configured in the Safety Matrix Engineering Tool are required for the operation of an OS.

If parameter changes are required to the F-channel drivers (an extended input signal range for example) or if signals used by an F-channel driver also used elsewhere in the program (for example, for the display or interlocking in the standard program), it is recommended that you create a process tag (CFC) for the signal. In this case, you can enable the ""Imported channel drivers (IEA support)"" function when transferring the matrix to the project.

In this way, not only the process value and its status is interconnected to the Safety Matrix, the inputs ""SIM_IN"", ""SIM_ON"", and ""SIM_V"", which the matrix uses for the maintenance function, as well as ""ACK_REI"" and ""ACK_REQ"", are also used to signal an acknowledgment request in the Safety Matrix and perform acknowledgment from here.

To enable the Safety Matrix to integrate external F-channel drivers into its full scope of functions, the ""SIM_IN"", ""SIM_ON"", ""SIM_V"", and ""ACK_REI"" I/Os may not be interconnected, since the Safety Matrix does not change the existing logic and thus cannot interconnect the inputs of the F-channel driver.

Channel drivers of types F_CH...*, F_PA…, F_Q… and F-typicals can be incorporated from Safety Matrix V6.2 and higher using the ""customer-specific"" option.

Operational procedures

During maintenance work in or while making changes to a plant, the operational procedures must be followed at all times.

Before changes can be made to safety-related parts of the plant or functions, a risk assessment relating to the change itself and how it is to be made must be carried out, particularly if it is to be made during operation. Only make changes if a risk assessment has been carried out beforehand and ensure that change instructions resulting from this are followed. If necessary, test program changes by loading them into a test CPU and checking the function.

Operational procedures

During maintenance work in or while making changes to a plant, the operational procedures must be followed at all times.

Before changes can be made to safety-related parts of the plant or functions, a risk assessment relating to the change itself and how it is to be made must be carried out, particularly if it is to be made during operation. Only make changes if a risk assessment has been carried out beforehand and ensure that change instructions resulting from this are followed. If necessary, test program changes by loading them into a test CPU and checking the function.

# 9.2 Preparing for changes

# Offline/online comparison

Before each CFC change, make sure that the offline and online programs are identical.

- To do this, open a chart from the AS in the CFC editor and switch to online mode.
- If there are differences between the offline and online versions, a message with an additional system prompt will appear; otherwise, the system will switch to online mode without prompting.

In the case of fail-safe functions in the AS, you must also check whether the signature from the last compilation matches the online signature in the AS (see Section Tracking changes in the safety program (Page 180)).

- If the signatures are not identical, or a prompt indicating that there are differences between the programs appears when you switch to online mode, you must determine what has changed and whether these changes can be downloaded.

# Version Cross Manager

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used as a tool for comparing two project versions, as well as the current project with a backed-up version of it (see Section Tracking changes in the safety program (Page 180)).

- The comparison function in S7 F-Systems can be used to list the differences in the safety program. You can access this comparison function by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window.
- The next window enables you to choose the versions to be compared.

Do not make any other changes if the offline and online versions are different and you do not know what the differences are.

# CPU utilization

Before making any changes, check the CPU utilization with regard to memory and cycle time. You can query how much memory has been allocated using the ""Module Information..."" function in the CPU.

- To do this, open ""Module Information..."" in the CPU and check how much memory is allocated at present on the ""Memory"" tab.
- To determine the cycle utilization, blocks TIME_BEG and TIME_ENG must be installed in the OBs in use and interconnected with one another. In the relevant CFC, check the runtimes of the OBs at output TM_DIFF_TI of the respective TIME_END block. Note that the run times of higher-priority OBs are also measured when this method of measuring the run times of lower-priority OBs is used, and will need to be subtracted accordingly. As of PCS V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the gross and net run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs can also be read at the CPU_RT block.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.2 Preparing for changes

Note: You can find more information in section Cyclic interrupts (Page 23).

# Checking the H parameters

In fault-tolerant systems, you must check the H parameters of the CPU.

- To do this, open the Object Properties of the CPU and switch to the ""H Parameters"" tab.
- If a ""Cyclic interrupt OB with special handling"" has been specified here, and the option ""Use only calculated values"" has been activated, use the ""Calculate..."" button to open the ""Update Reserve: Calculation of Monitoring Times"" window.
- Here, check the values in the entry fields ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned [ms]"" and ""Work memory used for all data blocks in the user program [Kbyte]"".
- Compare the runtime entered in the ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned [ms]"" field, for the cyclic interrupt OB with special handling, with the measured runtime (TIME_BEG, TIME_END of OB) or the runtime read at the CPU_RT block. The value entered should be approximately 10% greater than the measured one.
- Compare the value for ""Work memory used for all data blocks in the user program [Kbyte]"" with the object properties of the CPU block folder. There, in the ""Blocks"" register under ""Size in work memory: Data"", you will find the amount of memory that is occupied by data blocks (in bytes). This value (expressed in Kbytes), plus some reserve, must be entered in the ""Work memory used for all data blocks in the user program [Kbyte]"" field.
- If the values in the entry fields do not match the actual values, you must enter the current values and determine the H parameters using the ""Calculate..."" button.

Note: You can find more information in section Calculating monitoring times (Page 36).

# Checking the hardware before downloading

Before downloading the changes - and in particular, before downloading hardware configuration changes with HCiR - make sure that no errors are present in the system.

- The HCiR procedure involves stopping a CPU, performing the download, and then restarting the CPU.
- Immediately after the transition to RUN Redundant, the other CPU is stopped and restarted, during which time it is updated to the current configuration.
- If there is an error in a redundant component (e.g. the interface module of the ET 200M), this can cause the connection to a PROFIBUS slave to fail and input/output modules to be passivated.

# 9.3 Changes in CFC

# Changing the user program

Before you make changes to the standard or fail-safe program of an S7 F/FH systems, make sure that you can also download and check these changes. Changes to the standard or fail-safe program cannot be compiled or downloaded as part of a separate process. Therefore, you must follow the sequence below in full to make changes:

- Change CFC
- Check
- Compile
- Download
- Offline/online comparison
- Test
- Document

To change or add a fail-safe function, open the relevant CFC or add a new one.

# Runtime groups

When a new CFC is added, the system creates a new runtime group with the same name. Check whether its insert position in the editor is the position you require. When deleting safety functions, empty F-runtime groups may arise, which also have to be deleted. To do this with PCS 7 V7.0 and higher, execute the following command in the CFC editor: ""Edit > Delete Empty Runtime Groups"". With PCS 7 V6.1, activate the option ""Delete Empty Runtime Groups"" when compiling. Before inserting blocks, establish the predecessor block.

# Checking the H parameters

In fault-tolerant systems, you must check the H parameters of the CPU.

- To do this, open the Object Properties of the CPU and switch to the ""H Parameters"" tab.
- If a ""Cyclic interrupt OB with special handling"" has been specified here, and the option ""Use only calculated values"" has been activated, use the ""Calculate..."" button to open the ""Update Reserve: Calculation of Monitoring Times"" window.
- Here, check the values in the entry fields ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned [ms]"" and ""Work memory used for all data blocks in the user program [Kbyte]"".
- Compare the runtime entered in the ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned [ms]"" field, for the cyclic interrupt OB with special handling, with the measured runtime (TIME_BEG, TIME_END of OB) or the runtime read at the CPU_RT block. The value entered should be approximately 10% greater than the measured one.
- Compare the value for ""Work memory used for all data blocks in the user program [Kbyte]"" with the object properties of the CPU block folder. There, in the ""Blocks"" register under ""Size in work memory: Data"", you will find the amount of memory that is occupied by data blocks (in bytes). This value (expressed in Kbytes), plus some reserve, must be entered in the ""Work memory used for all data blocks in the user program [Kbyte]"" field.
- If the values in the entry fields do not match the actual values, you must enter the current values and determine the H parameters using the ""Calculate..."" button.

Note: You can find more information in section Calculating monitoring times (Page 36).

# Checking the hardware before downloading

Before downloading the changes - and in particular, before downloading hardware configuration changes with HCiR - make sure that no errors are present in the system.

- The HCiR procedure involves stopping a CPU, performing the download, and then restarting the CPU.
- Immediately after the transition to RUN Redundant, the other CPU is stopped and restarted, during which time it is updated to the current configuration.
- If there is an error in a redundant component (e.g. the interface module of the ET 200M), this can cause the connection to a PROFIBUS slave to fail and input/output modules to be passivated.

# Changing the user program

Before you make changes to the standard or fail-safe program of an S7 F/FH systems, make sure that you can also download and check these changes. Changes to the standard or fail-safe program cannot be compiled or downloaded as part of a separate process. Therefore, you must follow the sequence below in full to make changes:

- Change CFC
- Check
- Compile
- Download
- Offline/online comparison
- Test
- Document

To change or add a fail-safe function, open the relevant CFC or add a new one.

# Runtime groups

When a new CFC is added, the system creates a new runtime group with the same name. Check whether its insert position in the editor is the position you require. When deleting safety functions, empty F-runtime groups may arise, which also have to be deleted. To do this with PCS 7 V7.0 and higher, execute the following command in the CFC editor: ""Edit > Delete Empty Runtime Groups"". With PCS 7 V6.1, activate the option ""Delete Empty Runtime Groups"" when compiling. Before inserting blocks, establish the predecessor block.

You can find more information in section Access protection (Page 14).

If changes are to be downloaded during operation, safety mode must be deactivated on the AS and then reactivated once downloading is complete.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.2 Preparing for changes

# Offline/online comparison

Before each CFC change, make sure that the offline and online programs are identical.

- To do this, open a chart from the AS in the CFC editor and switch to online mode.
- If there are differences between the offline and online versions, a message with an additional system prompt will appear; otherwise, the system will switch to online mode without prompting.

In the case of fail-safe functions in the AS, you must also check whether the signature from the last compilation matches the online signature in the AS (see Section Tracking changes in the safety program (Page 180)).

- If the signatures are not identical, or a prompt indicating that there are differences between the programs appears when you switch to online mode, you must determine what has changed and whether these changes can be downloaded.

# Version Cross Manager

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used as a tool for comparing two project versions, as well as the current project with a backed-up version of it (see Section Tracking changes in the safety program (Page 180)).

- The comparison function in S7 F-Systems can be used to list the differences in the safety program. You can access this comparison function by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window.
- The next window enables you to choose the versions to be compared.

Do not make any other changes if the offline and online versions are different and you do not know what the differences are.

# CPU utilization

Before making any changes, check the CPU utilization with regard to memory and cycle time. You can query how much memory has been allocated using the ""Module Information..."" function in the CPU.

- To do this, open ""Module Information..."" in the CPU and check how much memory is allocated at present on the ""Memory"" tab.
- To determine the cycle utilization, blocks TIME_BEG and TIME_ENG must be installed in the OBs in use and interconnected with one another. In the relevant CFC, check the runtimes of the OBs at output TM_DIFF_TI of the respective TIME_END block. Note that the run times of higher-priority OBs are also measured when this method of measuring the run times of lower-priority OBs is used, and will need to be subtracted accordingly. As of PCS V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the gross and net run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs can also be read at the CPU_RT block.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.2 Preparing for changes

# Offline/online comparison

Before each CFC change, make sure that the offline and online programs are identical.

- To do this, open a chart from the AS in the CFC editor and switch to online mode.
- If there are differences between the offline and online versions, a message with an additional system prompt will appear; otherwise, the system will switch to online mode without prompting.

In the case of fail-safe functions in the AS, you must also check whether the signature from the last compilation matches the online signature in the AS (see Section Tracking changes in the safety program (Page 180)).

- If the signatures are not identical, or a prompt indicating that there are differences between the programs appears when you switch to online mode, you must determine what has changed and whether these changes can be downloaded.

# Version Cross Manager

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used as a tool for comparing two project versions, as well as the current project with a backed-up version of it (see Section Tracking changes in the safety program (Page 180)).

- The comparison function in S7 F-Systems can be used to list the differences in the safety program. You can access this comparison function by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window.
- The next window enables you to choose the versions to be compared.

Do not make any other changes if the offline and online versions are different and you do not know what the differences are.

# CPU utilization

Before making any changes, check the CPU utilization with regard to memory and cycle time. You can query how much memory has been allocated using the ""Module Information..."" function in the CPU.

- To do this, open ""Module Information..."" in the CPU and check how much memory is allocated at present on the ""Memory"" tab.
- To determine the cycle utilization, blocks TIME_BEG and TIME_ENG must be installed in the OBs in use and interconnected with one another. In the relevant CFC, check the runtimes of the OBs at output TM_DIFF_TI of the respective TIME_END block. Note that the run times of higher-priority OBs are also measured when this method of measuring the run times of lower-priority OBs is used, and will need to be subtracted accordingly. As of PCS V7.0 and an S7-400H CPU as of FW V4.5, the gross and net run times of the cyclic interrupt OBs can also be read at the CPU_RT block.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.2 Preparing for changes

Note: You can find more information in section Cyclic interrupts (Page 23).

# Checking the H parameters

In fault-tolerant systems, you must check the H parameters of the CPU.

- To do this, open the Object Properties of the CPU and switch to the ""H Parameters"" tab.
- If a ""Cyclic interrupt OB with special handling"" has been specified here, and the option ""Use only calculated values"" has been activated, use the ""Calculate..."" button to open the ""Update Reserve: Calculation of Monitoring Times"" window.
- Here, check the values in the entry fields ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned [ms]"" and ""Work memory used for all data blocks in the user program [Kbyte]"".
- Compare the runtime entered in the ""Runtime of the watchdog interrupt concerned [ms]"" field, for the cyclic interrupt OB with special handling, with the measured runtime (TIME_BEG, TIME_END of OB) or the runtime read at the CPU_RT block. The value entered should be approximately 10% greater than the measured one.
- Compare the value for ""Work memory used for all data blocks in the user program [Kbyte]"" with the object properties of the CPU block folder. There, in the ""Blocks"" register under ""Size in work memory: Data"", you will find the amount of memory that is occupied by data blocks (in bytes). This value (expressed in Kbytes), plus some reserve, must be entered in the ""Work memory used for all data blocks in the user program [Kbyte]"" field.
- If the values in the entry fields do not match the actual values, you must enter the current values and determine the H parameters using the ""Calculate..."" button.

Note: You can find more information in section Calculating monitoring times (Page 36).

# Checking the hardware before downloading

Before downloading the changes - and in particular, before downloading hardware configuration changes with HCiR - make sure that no errors are present in the system.

- The HCiR procedure involves stopping a CPU, performing the download, and then restarting the CPU.
- Immediately after the transition to RUN Redundant, the other CPU is stopped and restarted, during which time it is updated to the current configuration.
- If there is an error in a redundant component (e.g. the interface module of the ET 200M), this can cause the connection to a PROFIBUS slave to fail and input/output modules to be passivated.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.5 Downloading changes/Complete downloading

# Standard program

In an S7-400 F/FH system with a safety and standard program, changes can be made in the standard program in exactly the same way as with a standard system. However, since the fail-safe program may also be affected by a program error in the standard program (e.g. an infinite loop in a user block), changes in the standard program should be treated in the same way as changes in the safety program.

# Safety program

The procedure for downloading changes/complete downloading of programs with F-blocks is identical to the one used for the standard program. Additionally, safety mode must be deactivated before downloading changes and then reactivated once this is complete. Prior to loading the safety program, perform a consistency test. The signatures in the program information section and in the footer of the safety printout must be the same.

Note
You can find more information in section Safety mode and downloading the safety program (Page 115).

During a complete download, the CPU is stopped and must be restarted once the download is complete. When the CPU starts up, it goes into safety mode.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

# Backing up projects

In order to track changes, it is necessary to back up the project at regular intervals both before and after changes are made. A plant-wide decision should be taken regarding where project backups are to be stored and how the individual versions are to be named.

# Program comparison

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used for the entire program as a tool for comparing two program versions, as well as for comparing the current project with a backed-up version of it. Options for comparing the safety program can be accessed by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

For this reason, you must also check the signature in the AS.

- To do this, go online in CFC and open the @F_Shtdn chart.
- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# 9.7 Printing program data

You can use the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box to view, compare, and document many of the attributes of the safety program. It lists all the blocks that are contained in the safety program. F-runtime groups and charts can also be displayed.

Here, you will also find options for documenting the current safety program:

If necessary, change the block sequence in the runtime editor. The ""Optimize run sequence"" function does not optimize F-runtime groups. These are excluded from optimization.

# Function test

To test your functions, you can use S7-PLCSIM or, depending on your PCS 7 version, you can download your program to a real test AS. Use the ""Load to test AS"" function in both cases. To perform testing with S7-PLCSIM, start S7-PLCSIM and download HW Config and the CFC charts. Depending on the version of S7-PLCSIM you are working with, you may need to enter either the password ""plcsim"" (up to PLCSIM V5.3) or the configured CPU password (PLCSIM V5.4 and higher) in order to download CFC charts. Testing with S7-PLCSIM is not a substitute for carrying out a function test in the plant.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

Safety information

In HW Config, you will receive a message when you make changes to safety-related parameters. If you are unable to or do not wish to finalize the changes for the reason specified above, you can cancel them here and close HW Config without saving.

# 9.8 Plant acceptance

In the chart directory of your AS, within the SIMATIC Manager you then have the option of highlighting charts for printing purposes, and printing the selected charts using the ""File > Print > Object Content"" menu command.

# 9.8 Plant acceptance

Note

You can find information on acceptance of a plant, changes, or F block types in the ""SIMATIC Industrial Software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100) manual.

Two checklists are available for system documentation purposes:

- ""Process Safety – Configuration"" checklist

This list is used for documenting the system design and the software and hardware settings of the automation system in use.
- ""Process Safety – Verification/Testing""

This list enables you to document that the components in use have been tested against their requirements and specifications, and that the relevant function tests have been performed.

These lists are only templates and may be adapted to the requirements of your plant at any time.

If necessary, change the block sequence in the runtime editor. The ""Optimize run sequence"" function does not optimize F-runtime groups. These are excluded from optimization.

# Function test

To test your functions, you can use S7-PLCSIM or, depending on your PCS 7 version, you can download your program to a real test AS. Use the ""Load to test AS"" function in both cases. To perform testing with S7-PLCSIM, start S7-PLCSIM and download HW Config and the CFC charts. Depending on the version of S7-PLCSIM you are working with, you may need to enter either the password ""plcsim"" (up to PLCSIM V5.3) or the configured CPU password (PLCSIM V5.4 and higher) in order to download CFC charts. Testing with S7-PLCSIM is not a substitute for carrying out a function test in the plant.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

Safety information

In HW Config, you will receive a message when you make changes to safety-related parameters. If you are unable to or do not wish to finalize the changes for the reason specified above, you can cancel them here and close HW Config without saving.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.5 Downloading changes/Complete downloading

# Standard program

In an S7-400 F/FH system with a safety and standard program, changes can be made in the standard program in exactly the same way as with a standard system. However, since the fail-safe program may also be affected by a program error in the standard program (e.g. an infinite loop in a user block), changes in the standard program should be treated in the same way as changes in the safety program.

# Safety program

The procedure for downloading changes/complete downloading of programs with F-blocks is identical to the one used for the standard program. Additionally, safety mode must be deactivated before downloading changes and then reactivated once this is complete. Prior to loading the safety program, perform a consistency test. The signatures in the program information section and in the footer of the safety printout must be the same.

Note
You can find more information in section Safety mode and downloading the safety program (Page 115).

During a complete download, the CPU is stopped and must be restarted once the download is complete. When the CPU starts up, it goes into safety mode.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

# Backing up projects

In order to track changes, it is necessary to back up the project at regular intervals both before and after changes are made. A plant-wide decision should be taken regarding where project backups are to be stored and how the individual versions are to be named.

# Program comparison

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used for the entire program as a tool for comparing two program versions, as well as for comparing the current project with a backed-up version of it. Options for comparing the safety program can be accessed by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.7 Printing program data

For this reason, you must also check the signature in the AS.

- To do this, go online in CFC and open the @F_Shtdn chart.
- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# 9.7 Printing program data

You can use the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box to view, compare, and document many of the attributes of the safety program. It lists all the blocks that are contained in the safety program. F-runtime groups and charts can also be displayed.

Here, you will also find options for documenting the current safety program:

- Print
- - Please select the data to be printed:

Cancel
- Help

If you want to print all the charts, select the ""Chart (standard and F-chart)"" option. Individual charts or all F-charts can be printed from the SIMATIC Manager. If the printout is made from the ""Security Program"" window, a footer with the S7 F Systems version and the program signature is printed on each page.

Activate the options shown above to print the safety program and the hardware.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.7 Printing program data

For this reason, you must also check the signature in the AS.

- To do this, go online in CFC and open the @F_Shtdn chart.
- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# 9.7 Printing program data

You can use the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box to view, compare, and document many of the attributes of the safety program. It lists all the blocks that are contained in the safety program. F-runtime groups and charts can also be displayed.

Here, you will also find options for documenting the current safety program:

- Print
- - Please select the data to be printed:

Cancel
- Help

If you want to print all the charts, select the ""Chart (standard and F-chart)"" option. Individual charts or all F-charts can be printed from the SIMATIC Manager. If the printout is made from the ""Security Program"" window, a footer with the S7 F Systems version and the program signature is printed on each page.

Activate the options shown above to print the safety program and the hardware.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

Safety information

In HW Config, you will receive a message when you make changes to safety-related parameters. If you are unable to or do not wish to finalize the changes for the reason specified above, you can cancel them here and close HW Config without saving.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.5 Downloading changes/Complete downloading

# Standard program

In an S7-400 F/FH system with a safety and standard program, changes can be made in the standard program in exactly the same way as with a standard system. However, since the fail-safe program may also be affected by a program error in the standard program (e.g. an infinite loop in a user block), changes in the standard program should be treated in the same way as changes in the safety program.

# Safety program

The procedure for downloading changes/complete downloading of programs with F-blocks is identical to the one used for the standard program. Additionally, safety mode must be deactivated before downloading changes and then reactivated once this is complete. Prior to loading the safety program, perform a consistency test. The signatures in the program information section and in the footer of the safety printout must be the same.

Note
You can find more information in section Safety mode and downloading the safety program (Page 115).

During a complete download, the CPU is stopped and must be restarted once the download is complete. When the CPU starts up, it goes into safety mode.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

# Backing up projects

In order to track changes, it is necessary to back up the project at regular intervals both before and after changes are made. A plant-wide decision should be taken regarding where project backups are to be stored and how the individual versions are to be named.

# Program comparison

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used for the entire program as a tool for comparing two program versions, as well as for comparing the current project with a backed-up version of it. Options for comparing the safety program can be accessed by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.7 Printing program data

For this reason, you must also check the signature in the AS.

- To do this, go online in CFC and open the @F_Shtdn chart.
- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# 9.7 Printing program data

You can use the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box to view, compare, and document many of the attributes of the safety program. It lists all the blocks that are contained in the safety program. F-runtime groups and charts can also be displayed.

Here, you will also find options for documenting the current safety program:

- Print
- - Please select the data to be printed:

Cancel
- Help

If you want to print all the charts, select the ""Chart (standard and F-chart)"" option. Individual charts or all F-charts can be printed from the SIMATIC Manager. If the printout is made from the ""Security Program"" window, a footer with the S7 F Systems version and the program signature is printed on each page.

Activate the options shown above to print the safety program and the hardware.

# 9.8 Plant acceptance

Note

You can find information on acceptance of a plant, changes, or F block types in the ""SIMATIC Industrial Software S7 F/FH Systems - Configuring and Programming"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109742100) manual.

Two checklists are available for system documentation purposes:

- ""Process Safety – Configuration"" checklist

This list is used for documenting the system design and the software and hardware settings of the automation system in use.
- ""Process Safety – Verification/Testing""

This list enables you to document that the components in use have been tested against their requirements and specifications, and that the relevant function tests have been performed.

These lists are only templates and may be adapted to the requirements of your plant at any time.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

Safety information

In HW Config, you will receive a message when you make changes to safety-related parameters. If you are unable to or do not wish to finalize the changes for the reason specified above, you can cancel them here and close HW Config without saving.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.5 Downloading changes/Complete downloading

# Standard program

In an S7-400 F/FH system with a safety and standard program, changes can be made in the standard program in exactly the same way as with a standard system. However, since the fail-safe program may also be affected by a program error in the standard program (e.g. an infinite loop in a user block), changes in the standard program should be treated in the same way as changes in the safety program.

# Safety program

The procedure for downloading changes/complete downloading of programs with F-blocks is identical to the one used for the standard program. Additionally, safety mode must be deactivated before downloading changes and then reactivated once this is complete. Prior to loading the safety program, perform a consistency test. The signatures in the program information section and in the footer of the safety printout must be the same.

Note
You can find more information in section Safety mode and downloading the safety program (Page 115).

During a complete download, the CPU is stopped and must be restarted once the download is complete. When the CPU starts up, it goes into safety mode.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

# Backing up projects

In order to track changes, it is necessary to back up the project at regular intervals both before and after changes are made. A plant-wide decision should be taken regarding where project backups are to be stored and how the individual versions are to be named.

# Program comparison

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used for the entire program as a tool for comparing two program versions, as well as for comparing the current project with a backed-up version of it. Options for comparing the safety program can be accessed by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

Safety information

In HW Config, you will receive a message when you make changes to safety-related parameters. If you are unable to or do not wish to finalize the changes for the reason specified above, you can cancel them here and close HW Config without saving.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.5 Downloading changes/Complete downloading

# Standard program

In an S7-400 F/FH system with a safety and standard program, changes can be made in the standard program in exactly the same way as with a standard system. However, since the fail-safe program may also be affected by a program error in the standard program (e.g. an infinite loop in a user block), changes in the standard program should be treated in the same way as changes in the safety program.

# Safety program

The procedure for downloading changes/complete downloading of programs with F-blocks is identical to the one used for the standard program. Additionally, safety mode must be deactivated before downloading changes and then reactivated once this is complete. Prior to loading the safety program, perform a consistency test. The signatures in the program information section and in the footer of the safety printout must be the same.

Note
You can find more information in section Safety mode and downloading the safety program (Page 115).

During a complete download, the CPU is stopped and must be restarted once the download is complete. When the CPU starts up, it goes into safety mode.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

# Backing up projects

In order to track changes, it is necessary to back up the project at regular intervals both before and after changes are made. A plant-wide decision should be taken regarding where project backups are to be stored and how the individual versions are to be named.

# Program comparison

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used for the entire program as a tool for comparing two program versions, as well as for comparing the current project with a backed-up version of it. Options for comparing the safety program can be accessed by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.7 Printing program data

For this reason, you must also check the signature in the AS.

- To do this, go online in CFC and open the @F_Shtdn chart.
- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# 9.7 Printing program data

You can use the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box to view, compare, and document many of the attributes of the safety program. It lists all the blocks that are contained in the safety program. F-runtime groups and charts can also be displayed.

Here, you will also find options for documenting the current safety program:

- Print
- - Please select the data to be printed:

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

If necessary, change the block sequence in the runtime editor. The ""Optimize run sequence"" function does not optimize F-runtime groups. These are excluded from optimization.

# Function test

To test your functions, you can use S7-PLCSIM or, depending on your PCS 7 version, you can download your program to a real test AS. Use the ""Load to test AS"" function in both cases. To perform testing with S7-PLCSIM, start S7-PLCSIM and download HW Config and the CFC charts. Depending on the version of S7-PLCSIM you are working with, you may need to enter either the password ""plcsim"" (up to PLCSIM V5.3) or the configured CPU password (PLCSIM V5.4 and higher) in order to download CFC charts. Testing with S7-PLCSIM is not a substitute for carrying out a function test in the plant.

# 9.4 Changes in HW Config

CiR allows you to add or remove F signal modules at the end of an ET 200M rack. An attempt to change a parameter on an F signal module is rejected by the system with an error message during the CiR loading process. As of S7 F Configuration Pack V5.5 SP12, you are notified that loading is only possible in the STOP state of the AS.

H-CiR allows you to add new F I/Os to any free slots or remove existing F I/Os. In this way, by removing and adding the F I/Os in two steps, you can change the configuration without stopping the AS. Re-configuration in one step is not supported.

Note

Follow the instructions in the manuals:

- ""SIMATIC High Availability Systems S7-400H""
- ""SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation""

Signature value of the signal module

Safety-related settings of the fail-safe signal modules are entered in the signature of the fail-safe program. The signature value of a fail-safe signal module appears as an input parameter on the F-module driver.

To update this value, after safety-related parameters have been changed in the HW configuration the changes need to be compiled using ""Generate module drivers"" and downloaded in the CFC editor.

Safety information

In HW Config, you will receive a message when you make changes to safety-related parameters. If you are unable to or do not wish to finalize the changes for the reason specified above, you can cancel them here and close HW Config without saving.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.5 Downloading changes/Complete downloading

# Standard program

In an S7-400 F/FH system with a safety and standard program, changes can be made in the standard program in exactly the same way as with a standard system. However, since the fail-safe program may also be affected by a program error in the standard program (e.g. an infinite loop in a user block), changes in the standard program should be treated in the same way as changes in the safety program.

# Safety program

The procedure for downloading changes/complete downloading of programs with F-blocks is identical to the one used for the standard program. Additionally, safety mode must be deactivated before downloading changes and then reactivated once this is complete. Prior to loading the safety program, perform a consistency test. The signatures in the program information section and in the footer of the safety printout must be the same.

Note
You can find more information in section Safety mode and downloading the safety program (Page 115).

During a complete download, the CPU is stopped and must be restarted once the download is complete. When the CPU starts up, it goes into safety mode.

# 9.6 Tracking changes in the safety program

# Backing up projects

In order to track changes, it is necessary to back up the project at regular intervals both before and after changes are made. A plant-wide decision should be taken regarding where project backups are to be stored and how the individual versions are to be named.

# Program comparison

The ""Version Cross Manager"" can be used for the entire program as a tool for comparing two program versions, as well as for comparing the current project with a backed-up version of it. Options for comparing the safety program can be accessed by clicking the ""Compare..."" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog.

# Signature of the safety program

The program signature is used to identify a safety program. It changes each time a change is made to the safety program. As a result, comparing the signature values of two safety programs provides an initial indication of what changes have been made in the safety program.

The signature of the current safety program in an AS can be found in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window. To do this, in the SIMATIC Manager select the CPU that contains the safety program and use the ""Options > Edit Safety Program"" menu command to open the relevant dialog. In this dialog, you can find three signatures with an associated date:

- The date on which CFCs were last compiled and the signature formed. This date is changed after delta compiling with changes to the safety program and after complete compiling without changes to the safety program.
- The date on which a safety program was saved as a reference, and which signature the reference program has.
- The date of the last online change and the signature formed for this. Several online changes may have been made since the last compilation.

Save the program you have checked as a reference using the ""Reference"" button in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window; enter the password if requested to do so and answer ""Yes"" to the query that appears following this.

The signatures shown in the ""Edit Safety Program"" window do not need to match the signature in the AS. It may, for example, be possible that the most recent changes were compiled, but not downloaded and checked.

# Changes, tracking changes, and acceptance

# 9.7 Printing program data

For this reason, you must also check the signature in the AS.

- To do this, go online in CFC and open the @F_Shtdn chart.
- While online, you can view the signature of the safety program in the AS at output F_SIG_OUT of the F_SHUTDN block.

For change tracking purposes, it is worth manually documenting both the signature value of the safety program and the name of the project backup in a log file.

Note

You can find additional information about changing the time stamp and signature in the FAQ ""When do the time stamp and signature change in the ""Edit safety program"" dialog?"" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/62046624).

# 9.7 Printing program data

You can use the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box to view, compare, and document many of the attributes of the safety program. It lists all the blocks that are contained in the safety program. F-runtime groups and charts can also be displayed.

Here, you will also find options for documenting the current safety program:

- Print
- - Please select the data to be printed:

Cancel
- Help

If you want to print all the charts, select the ""Chart (standard and F-chart)"" option. Individual charts or all F-charts can be printed from the SIMATIC Manager. If the printout is made from the ""Security Program"" window, a footer with the S7 F Systems version and the program signature is printed on each page.

Activate the options shown above to print the safety program and the hardware.

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.1 Access protection

An S7 F/FH system being operated as a safety system is protected by two passwords:

- The CPU password is configured in the hardware configuration and is intended to protect the CPU against accidental downloading or the wrong program being downloaded.
- Another password is configured in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box, It protects the fail-safe user program and the parameters of the signal modules and, where necessary, the parameters of the CPU (option in the ""Protection"" register of the CPU properties).

# 5.1.1 General measures

You can restrict access to the ES by implementing access protection for authorized persons:

To do this you can, for example, install the ES in an operating area that can only be accessed by these persons.

You can use the options offered by the operating system by protecting the ES with a password and setting a screen saver that is activated automatically.

To protect the safety program, you can implement organizational measures to ensure that:

- The passwords for the CPU and safety program can only be accessed by authorized persons.
- The timer is reset for the security password (menu ""Options > Edit safety program > Password > Cancel"" or close all applications and the SIMATIC Manager).
- Authorized persons expressly reset access authorization for the F-CPU before exiting the ES (by selecting ""CPU > Access authorization > Cancel"" or closing all applications in the SIMATIC Manager).

# 5.1.2 Access protection with SIMATIC Logon

As of PCS 7 V7.0, it is possible to set up access protection for individual subprojects with SIMATIC Logon. With a station-selective multiproject structure, this means that it is possible to assign access rights to protect AS projects with F program.

# Requirement

The SIMATIC Logon Service V1.3 SP1 or higher is installed.

# Advanced PCS 7 ES settings

# 5.1 Access protection

An S7 F/FH system being operated as a safety system is protected by two passwords:

- The CPU password is configured in the hardware configuration and is intended to protect the CPU against accidental downloading or the wrong program being downloaded.
- Another password is configured in the ""Edit Safety Program"" dialog box, It protects the fail-safe user program and the parameters of the signal modules and, where necessary, the parameters of the CPU (option in the ""Protection"" register of the CPU properties).

# 5.1.1 General measures

You can restrict access to the ES by implementing access protection for authorized persons:

To do this you can, for example, install the ES in an operating area that can only be accessed by these persons.

You can use the options offered by the operating system by protecting the ES with a password and setting a screen saver that is activated automatically.

To protect the safety program, you can implement organizational measures to ensure that:

- The passwords for the CPU and safety program can only be accessed by authorized persons.
- The timer is reset for the security password (menu ""Options > Edit safety program > Password > Cancel"" or close all applications and the SIMATIC Manager).
- Authorized persons expressly reset access authorization for the F-CPU before exiting the ES (by selecting ""CPU > Access authorization > Cancel"" or closing all applications in the SIMATIC Manager).

# 5.1.2 Access protection with SIMATIC Logon

As of PCS 7 V7.0, it is possible to set up access protection for individual subprojects with SIMATIC Logon. With a station-selective multiproject structure, this means that it is possible to assign access rights to protect AS projects with F program.
