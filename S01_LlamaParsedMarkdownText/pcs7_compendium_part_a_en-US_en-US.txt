# Preface

# Subject of the manual

As a distinctly open system, SIMATIC PCS 7 can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of customer needs. The system software provides the configuration engineer with a great deal of freedom in terms of project configuration, as well as in the design of the program and visualization.

Experience has shown that subsequent modernization or plant expansion work is made much easier if the project is configured in conformance with PCS 7 as far as possible right from the start. This means users must adhere to certain basic rules to ensure that the provided system functions will offer optimum usability in the future.

This manual serves as a compendium in addition to the product documentation for SIMATIC PCS 7. The basic tasks for creating and configuring the project are described in the form of instructions with numerous illustrations.

The compendium directly reflects the recommended method for configuration, which is based on the results of a great deal of practical experience. The description relates to working with the project and the parameter settings of the components it contains but not the application itself.

The compendium is divided into the following parts:

- Configuration guidelines including checklist
- Process safety including two checklists
- Technical functions with SFC types

# Preparation and administration

# 4.1 Overview

Introduction

Implementation of the required automation functions is often possible with PCS 7 in various ways. The work steps described in this document for project creation, configuration and parameter assignment provide the basis for the PCS 7 application to be created. The following aspects play an important role in this for the complete runtime of the system:

- Availability

The availability of the overall system can be influenced by appropriate actions in the PCS 7 application starting in the planning phase.
- Expandability

Expansions and/or changes will need to be made repeatedly following the initial commissioning of a PCS 7 system. Attention must be paid to this when creating the PCS 7 application so that these can be executed more efficiently.
- Maintainability

According to the IEEE 610.12-1990 standard, software maintenance is understood to be "the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment".
- Legibility

Among other things, one of the principles of programming in IT theory is that the software must be created legibly. The requirements are that the code is well formatted, corresponding identifiers are used and meaningful comments are inserted. The following points should be achieved or improved by adhering to these principles:
- Options for reviewing the software in order to improve its correctness and robustness
- Options for maintaining the software
- Options for expanding the software

The following section provides an overview of the topics in this section.

Configuration guidelines for the PCS 7 application

Approved specifications are a prerequisite for configuring a PCS 7 system in the GMP environment (Good Manufacturing Practice). Projects of this type generally follow the GAMP 5 approach. GAMP 5 is a recognized standard that is used as a guideline for the validation. Adherence to the guidelines has a positive influence on the following aspects:

- Compliance with legal regulations
- Quality of the products
- Production efficiency
- Cost savings

Even in projects where there are fewer legal regulations to be complied with and less stringent requirements regarding quality and efficiency, a similar and possibly toned down approach (e.g. the so-called GAMP light) can be applied whereby only terms and phases from GAMP 5 are used.

Note

You can find detailed information about the requirements in the GMP-regulated industry and how they are implemented in product selection, configuration and operation of a system, including examples, in the manual: GMP Engineering

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

In accordance with the V model of the GAMP 5 approach, the documents build on each other and become increasingly more detailed. However, it is not only creation of the PCS 7 solution that is defined and regulated with these guidelines. They also form a very good basis for all future work on a PCS 7 plant and provide consistent quality over the plant's entire lifecycle.

The following specifications must be observed:

- User Requirement Specification (URS)
- Functional Specification (FS)
- Design Specification (DS)

The test documents used for reviewing and documenting adherence to the specifications are just as important:

- Factory Acceptance Test (FAT), also known as Installation Qualification (IQ)
- Site Acceptance Test (SAT) also known as Operational Qualification (OQ)
- Performance Qualification (PQ)

These documents are used for quality assurance purposes during a plant's entire lifecycle. The PCS 7 compendia should be taken into account for the design guidelines and test specifications.

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

# 4.2.2 Plant concept

Introduction

The following plant concept is used in this documentation as an example for implementing process automation:

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

The concept presented consists of the following components:

- 1 engineering station (ES): Central station for configuring the complete automation solution.
- 2 automation systems (AS 410S and AS 410H): for automation of two plant areas, for example, "Reactor 1" and "Reactor 2".
- 1 OS server with redundant OS server as a partner station for providing the process pictures and process data for operating the plant.
- 4 OS clients for centralized and decentralized process operation.

This structure can be easily scaled to larger quantity structures by adding further automation systems or redundant OS server pairs.

Note

Derivation of the appropriate automation solution for a process plant is explained in more detail through an overview of typical questions in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" manual. Taking this overview into account is recommended for effective planning of the plant.

# 4.2.3 Hardware selection

# Recommended hardware configuration

The PC hardware should correspond to the recommended hardware configuration, which is described in the supplied "PCS 7 Readme" documentation for the PCS 7 version to be installed.

Above all, it should be ensured that there is sufficient RAM, fast hard drives and industrial compatibility for the place of use in order to avoid performance limitations at a later date.

# Recommended hardware (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Use SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstations based on SIMATIC IPC. These are system-tested and pre-installed with the relevant PCS 7 version. Expenditure from installation, maintenance and repair of the PC hardware is thereby reduced considerably.

Note

Special attention should be paid to hardware compatibility for the following 64-bit Windows operating systems released for PCS 7 V9.0: Windows 7, Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB and Windows Server 2012 R2. Refer to the hardware compatibility matrix in the "PCS 7 Readme V9.0" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109744312) document in this regard.

Various configurations are available for PCS 7. The technical requirements, e.g. support for a large number of client connections as well for compatibility, dictate the possible operating systems for the PCS 7 application.

The following operating systems were used in connection with an Industrial Workstation IPC for the example configuration:

- OS server: Windows Server 2012 R2
- Engineering system (ES): Windows Server 2012 R2
- OS clients: Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB

Note
You can find an overview of the supported operating systems and PCS 7 configurations in the "Compatibility list PCS 7 configurations and operating systems" in PCS 7 Readme. Likewise, you can use the compatibility tool (www.siemens.com/kompatool) to check individual PCS 7 applications and operating systems for compatibility.

# 4.2.5 Naming concept

Rules for computer names

The selection of the computer name is crucial to the project configuration. Select short and descriptive computer names that provide some information about the function of the PC station in the overall plant. Note the following rules:

- The computer name may only contain uppercase letters and numbers.
- The computer name must start with a letter.
- The computer name may only contain up to 15 characters (limited by the operating system).

Note
The following names must be identical when you configure an OS or BATCH Server and an Engineering Station:

- Computer name
- Name of the PC station

- WinCC online help (search string "illegal characters")

# Changing computer names

The computer name can no longer be changed after the installation of PCS 7. If you do change the computer name, you will have to install the computer again (Restore DVD). Changing computer names often leads to problems in practice (e.g. in the case of multi-station systems with the SQL server installed).

The following rules must be adhered to:

- If you want to change the computer name for bundle PCs outside of the restore process, perform a new installation with the Restore DVD.
- If you want to change the computer name for a PC you have installed yourself, reinstall Windows.

# 4.2.6 Workgroup and domain

# Working environment

You have the option of operating the computers in your PCS 7 plant in a workgroup or domain environment.

The following tables present a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages (from a technical perspective) as well as scenarios (examples) and their use in workgroups and domains.

Note

This information is provided as a basis for discussion to assist you in the selection of the appropriate environment for your computers. In addition to the technical criteria, also consider organizational criteria (for example, plant-specific IT, Microsoft expertise, resources, workload and maintenance, etc.).

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

# Workgroup example

In the workgroup, the majority of settings have to be made on the local computer. If a PCS 7 plant is running with fixed settings, however, and few changes are expected, these settings only need to be made once. In this case, additional time for creating a domain and providing extra training for the operating personnel is not required.

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

# 4.2.7 User administration

# User concept

Use of the following roles for a PCS 7 system is recommended when planning the user concept:

- PCS 7 installation
A user account which is a member of the local administrator group is required to start the PCS 7 set-up.
- Windows users for operator stations and engineering stations
Working permanently with administrator rights on the PCS 7 system is not recommended once the installation is complete for security reasons. This means that at least one additional Windows user is required on each station. In addition to the user groups required by PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC HMI), membership in the "user" group will suffice.

Note

For some PCS 7 components (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, Process Historian [PH]), belonging to the group of administrators and logging in with administrator rights to the station and to the component is required. You will find further information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the manual "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755). You can find additional information on the Process Historian in the manual "Process Historian: Administration" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689).
- Logging onto OS Runtime (with SIMATIC Logon)
For each operator you can create a Windows user who logs on with the allocated user rights with activated OS runtime. For this a Windows user only needs rights in the corresponding groups that are also set up in the OS configuration. The same applies analogously to the PCS 7 "SIMATIC BATCH" and "SIMATIC Route Control" options.
- Logging onto SIMATIC Manager
For each project engineer you can create a Windows user in order to record configuration changes in the change log. Windows users only require rights in the corresponding SIMATIC logon groups.

# Preparation and administration

# 4.2 Preparatory planning

Note

The following guidelines apply to creating a new user account in accordance with Microsoft Windows Help:

- A user name may not be the same as another user or group name on the computer being managed.
- The name may contain up to 20 small or upper case letters and figures.
- The characters " / \ [ ] : ; | = , + * ? < >" are not permitted in user names.
- A user name may not consist solely of periods (.) or spaces.

SIMATIC Logon (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

SIMATIC Logon can be used without an additional license as of PCS 7 V7.1. Logon using SIMATIC Logon groups is recommended for OS Runtime as well as for the PCS 7 "SIMATIC BATCH" and "SIMATIC Route Control" options.

# 4.2.8 Backup management

# Introduction

Creating at least one backup of the operational system partition including the PCS 7 installation and storing this in case of any potential failure is required in order to increase availability of the plant and to reduce failure times.

In connection with this a restore DVD is also supplied with the SIMATIC PCS 7 industrial workstation (IPC). You can find additional information in your IPC operating instructions.

PCS 7 multiprojects are archived via a SIMATIC manager function, meaning that no backup needs to be created for a data partition.

# Preparation and administration

# 4.3 Installation

# Licensing mode (Windows Server 2012 R2)

Ensure that the operating systems are licensed correctly on all PCS 7 stations and that adequate Microsoft Client Access licenses (CAL) are available for accessing a Windows server operating system via the network.

All stations with a Windows server operating system installed are set to "Pro Server" licensing mode in their control panel as standard.

Select the "per device or per user" option button for the licensing mode if more than one server or more than five clients are present in one area.

You can use the "Licensing" tool (Folder start menu &gt; Administrative Tools) to manage the CAL settings centrally from a Windows server in a network with multiple Windows servers.

Example configuration: Redundant OS server (2 servers), 5 OS clients, and 1 ES

|5 CALs|are available for each OS server|
|---|---|
|Each OS client or ES|requires 1 CAL|
|Available CALs|10 CALs (red. OS server)|
|Required CALs|5 CALs (OS clients) + 1 CAL (ES) = 6 CALs|
|Reserve|4 CALs|

Note
At a changeover to a newer Windows Server version (e.g. Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2), the CALs must also be adapted to the new version.

# Internet time

Ensure that the Windows system time is not automatically synchronized via the Internet where the PC stations are operated in a workgroup (Change date/time &gt; Internet time). This allows you to avoid corresponding error messages from the Windows time service in the events display.

# Virus scanners

By setting up a virus scan solution you can reduce the risk of plant faults occurring as a result of malware. Virus scanners approved for PCS 7 can be installed later.

Suitable virus scan software versions from manufacturers "Symantec", "McAfee" and "Trend Micro" have been tested and approved for each PCS 7 version. You can find the relevant approved software version in the "PCS 7 Readme" documentation. You can find information about this in the Compatibility tool (www.siemens.com/kompatool).

Note
You can find information on installing and managing virus scanners within PCS 7 systems in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Managing Virus Scanners (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/38625951)" manual.

# Additional software

Only install the software products mentioned in the documentation on a PCS 7 PC, e.g. MS Office components or burning software. The MS Office applications Word, Excel, and Access can be used in process mode on client computers (OS, BATCH, Maintenance, WEB). However, their use may result in significantly reduced performance in some situations. Office must not be used in process mode on any other operator stations and BATCH stations. The user bears sole responsibility when third-party products are used. If you require third-party products, these should be installed before you install PCS 7. PCS 7 and third-party products must not be active at the same time.

# Network security (as part of Lifecycle agreements)

Install a virus scanner solution for the terminal bus and supply this with current patterns. Only install software approved by Siemens on all stations with process mode.

Setting the transmission rate and operating mode in the network

Siemens devices, including Industrial Ethernet switches (SCALANCE X) and the Industrial Ethernet CPs (CP 443-1 as of version 1EX10) are factory set for automatic detection of the parameters for transmission rate and operating mode (autosensing, autonegotiation).

Autosensing describes the property of network components to automatically interpret an incoming transmission signal. In this case, the device independently determines if the signal has a data rate of 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, or 1,000 Mbps. No explicit setting has to be made.

Autonegotiation enables the devices involved to negotiate the transmission conditions before data packets are transmitted. In so doing both the transmission rate (10/100/1000 Mbps) as well as the transmission mode are negotiated. Half-duplex or full-duplex are the options for the transmission method.

The following applies as of PCS 7 V6.1: Retain the factory settings.

Note

The only time you need to manually set the two components on the patch cable to a uniform transmission setting, for example 100 Mbps full-duplex, is when one of the components on the plant bus or terminal bus does not support the autonegotiation function. Deviating settings may lead to unpredictable error scenarios.

1. Rename the compatible network connection, e.g. to "terminal bus".
2. Select the "Advanced -> Advanced Settings..." command via the "terminal bus" connection context menu in order to set the network adapters. In order to ensure fault-free communication via the terminal bus on all nodes (e.g. OS servers, OS clients), the relevant network card must be located in first position as regards the order in which the network services are accessed.

Note

The setting of the connection order is neither possible nor necessary for Windows 10.

1. Ensure that the energy-saving option is switched off in the network card properties.
2. Set the same work group for all PCS 7 stations where you are not using a domain structure.
3. Create the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files for the NETBIOS name resolution and distribute these files to all PCS 7 stations. The "LMHOSTS" file is located in the following file path in Windows: "<Drive>\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\".
4. In the "LMHOSTS" file use the parameter #PRE for each computer name to be entered so that this name is entered into the so-called NETBIOS cache when the computer is booted up. (The cache can be displayed via the command line using the "nbtstat –c" command)

Note

You can find additional information on the setup, management and protection of network structures such as workgroups and domains in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Security Concept PCS 7 & WinCC (Basic)" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/60119725) document. After installation of the operating system, the "public network" network profile is configured by default for the network connections, which is not released for the terminal bus in PCS 7. You can find information on the connection to the terminal bus in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 - PC Configuration" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual ("How to set up a work group for connection to the terminal bus" section).

NOTICE

In the case of logical network segmentation using a subnet mask based on the same physical network (shared plant and terminal bus), the "Internet protocol version 6 (TCP/IPv6)" check box must be cleared. IPv6 should not be deactivated using the check box in the properties of the "Internet protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)". Instead, the approach recommended by Microsoft should be used for this: (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929852/how-to-disable-ipv6-or-its-components-in-windows)

Checking the availability of communication partners

Once the network settings for the terminal bus are completed, you can use the SIMATIC Shell tool on each station to check if the required partner stations (ES, OS server, and OS clients) can be seen on the terminal bus. SIMATIC Shell is available as a folder in the workspace of the Windows Explorer.

If there is no required partner station in SIMATIC Shell, it may indicate that the TCP/IP name resolution is poorly set. There are several concepts for a TCP/IP network in this regard, beginning with the editing of the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files and continuing with the use of WINS/DNS servers.

# Preparation and administration

# 4.3 Installation

You can trigger a refresh of the SIMATIC Shell using "Settings ..." in the shortcut menu. Select the network adapter for the terminal bus and click "OK". From PCS 7 V8.1 onwards, encrypted communication is possible. If you activate encrypted communication, only the computers for which a common key is defined can communicate with one another. You can find additional information on this in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 - PC Configuration" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.

Check of DNS name resolution

After completing the network settings for the terminal bus, you can use the "nslookup" tool (Name Server Lookup) to check whether the DNS name resolution is working correctly, i.e. supports the IPv4 protocol.

1. Open a command prompt window (cmd) and enter the command "nslookup". The response to the "nslookup" command indicates that the server is attempting to resolve the DNS name using the IPv6 protocol.
2. To change the DNS name resolution to the IPv4 protocol, change to the network adapter settings.
3. Open the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6).

# 4.3.7 Configuring the plant bus

Communication of a PCS 7 ES via the plant bus

In SIMATIC PCS 7, the "S7 online" access point must be set to the "PC internal" interface. All access to the AS – in order to check the module information of an AS or to download S7 programs, for example – is performed via "PC internal". "PC internal" is a centrally configurable interface, which can be loaded with project-specific settings for all stations on the plant bus. The settings are made on the ES in the PCS 7 multiproject and downloaded from the ES. You can find the relevant procedure in Section "Engineering Station (Page 64)". The communication on the plant bus is normally based on the ISO protocol.

Note

Use TCP/IP on the plant bus under the following conditions:

- Shared (combined) terminal and plant bus for smaller systems without an OS server
- Routing via subnets required
- Use of an automation system with integrated Ethernet interface
- Use of NTP (Network Time Protocol) for time synchronization
- Monitoring of network components on the plant bus for asset management
- Operation of gateways on the plant bus (external connection of an AS)
- Configuration of "S7 connection (fault-tolerant)" for H-systems via the internal interface of the CPU 41x with PROFINET or CP443-1

Use the ISO protocol on the plant bus under the following conditions:

- Configuration of "S7 connection (fault-tolerant)" for H-systems (pertains to CPU firmware versions before V5)
- Time synchronization based on the SIMATIC procedure

Note

When fault-tolerant S7 connections via TCP/IP or ISO-on-TCP are used, set the monitoring time (multiplier x 100 ms) in the connection properties.

- Up to 12 connections: Multiplier 5 (0.5 s)
- Up to 30 connections: Multiplier 10 (1 s)
- Up to 80 connections: Multiplier 20 (2 s)
- Up to 120 connections: Multiplier 30 (3 s)

# Preparation and administration

# 4.3 Installation

# Using CP16x3/CP16x8

Using a CP16x3/CP16x8 in the engineering station or OS server has the following benefits:

- More than eight AS can be connected.
- High availability AS–OS connections with automatic switching of the communication can be configured (also possible with a network card for CPUs with firmware V6 or higher).
- The "OS simulation" function can also be used for a redundant automation system.
- The CP MAC address can have parameters assigned to it or be modified.

Note
If a BCE (Basic Communication Ethernet) module is being used for communication instead of the CP16x3/CP16x8, parameters cannot be assigned to the MAC address. In the event of a fault (e.g. defective module) this may mean that the connections have to be reconfigured by the new MAC address of the replacement module and the project documentation has to be changed.

The following two TCP/UP protocols can be operated in parallel in the CP16x3/CP16x8:

- Windows communication (via the NDIS adapter)
- Communication via the "S7 online" access point (can be configured in NetPro/HW config)

Note
Different TCP/IP addresses have to be set in both TCP/IP protocols of the CP16x3/CP16x8 for unique identification purposes. This applies in particular from version PCS 7 V7.1. Starting with this version, the NDIS adapter for CP16x3/CP16x8 is installed automatically by the PCS 7 Setup and must not be deactivated subsequently.

# Preparation and administration

# 4.3 Installation Procedure

The following steps demonstrate how to configure the plant bus:

1. If there is a network connection for CP16x3/CP16x8 in Windows, deactivate the "Client for Microsoft Networks" and "File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks" protocols in this network connection, as these two Microsoft protocols are only required at the plant bus.
2. Check the current configuration of your installed network cards with the "communication settings" tool ("Start > All programs > Siemens Automation > SIMATIC > SIMATIC NET > Communication settings"). The plant bus is generally configured via the SIMATIC Manager of your ES and is described in the "Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)" section.
3. Check that the MAC address and the TCP/IP addresses correspond with the planning.

# 4.3.9 License management

Introduction

A process for managing evidence of the existing licenses should be defined for all stages in the lifecycle of a PCS 7 plant. This management should cover all the licenses used in a plant. The following points must be taken into account:

- Storage location
- Person responsible
- Access
- Procedure when a license is lost or defective

The serial number of each individual license should be listed in addition to the description and article number so that the license documents can be clearly matched with the licenses that are installed.

Use a defined station, e.g. the ES, in order to manage all license packages ordered centrally with the "Automation License Manager" program.

# 4.4 Administration tasks

# 4.4.1 Tools for PC administration

Microsoft Management Console (MMC)

You can add the computer management for each PC station as a "Snap-In" in a Microsoft Management Console arranged by you. This allows you to manage all PC stations centrally from one computer (e.g. SIMATIC Management Console, ES). For example you can check the event displays for all stations or add new users to all stations.

You can find additional information on MMC in the Step-by-Step Guide to the Microsoft Management Console.

SIMATIC Assessment Suite – Data Collector (SAS-DC)

The SIMATIC Assessment Suite - Data Collector (SAS-DC) provides you with the option of compiling diagnostics and system information. There is the option of compiling diagnostics and system information from one local system or from systems on the network and archiving these together as one ZIP file per scanned computer.

You can find additional information on SAS-DC in the How can you efficiently collect diagnostics and system information? FAQ.

Expanded diagnostics for PCS 7 plants

The diagnostics available within the framework of PCS 7 plants should be collected and evaluated using preventive measures. Automated and uniform diagnostics are required to increase the quality of the diagnostics results and for comparison purposes.

You can find additional information about this in the following FAQs:

- What diagnostics options are available for WinCC and PCS 7 OS?
- How do you create a memory dump for diagnostics purposes in WinCC and PCS 7?

# Preparation and administration

# 4.4 Administration tasks

# 4.4.2 Documentation and inventories

# Introduction

Once the installation is complete, document the actual state of the PC stations and the software products in use. Record the deviation from the desired state separately. The existing project documents, e.g. the plant overview plan, the network plan and the network address list should be checked accordingly and updated as necessary.

# SIMATIC Management Console

Using the PCS 7 system component "SIMATIC Management Console", an inventory of the installed hardware and software components of the entire PCS 7 system can be created from a central location. The inventory data can then be exported and documented as a report in XLSX format or as a PDF file.

Note

Starting with PCS 7 V9.0 you can store the inventory data of your system under your System ID in Siemens Technical Support. The ensures more efficient and targeted advice. You can find additional information on this in the "System Registration – System ID" (Page 88) section.

You can find additional information on the SIMATIC Management Console in the following Entries:

- Application example: "Tool supported lifecycle management of PCS 7 plants (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109479546)"
- Manual: "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC Management Console (V9.0)" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748755)

# Recommendations

If you do not use the SIMATIC Management Console, please note the following recommendations:

- Export a list of the SIMATIC software installed for each PC station. The list is automatically created by the SIMATIC Assessment Suite – Data Collector.
- Export a list of the licenses installed for each PC station via the Automation License Manager.
- Use the export function of the Windows own system information program (msinfo32.exe) to determine the existing hardware and software installation.

# Installation data storage media

A process for managing installation data storage media should be defined for all stages in the lifecycle of a PCS 7 plant. Among others the following points should be taken into account:

- Are there installation data storage media available for all software components?
- Who is responsible for maintaining the installation data storage media?
- Are the installation data storage media up-to-date?
- Where and how are the installation data storage media stored?
- How is access to the installation data storage media regulated?

In this regard all the types of data storage media you need, e.g. for reinstallations of software products or libraries, must be examined.

# Backups

Images are often created when PCs are installed in order to have restore points on the one hand in the event that faults occur later on in the installation, and so that any reinstallation can be completed more efficiently on the other.

Attention must be paid to the following points when managing images:

- Secure storage location
- Detailed description for each image

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

This section describes how to create a PCS 7 project as a so-called multiproject on the Engineering Station (ES). The description is based on the hardware architecture established in the previous section:

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.1 General configuration rules

# Introduction

Before you create your own multiproject, you should be familiar with these important rules. This will help you to avoid carrying out certain tasks twice.

# Central configuration

The entire configuration is performed on the ES in PCS 7 before the OS projects are loaded to the respective PCs.

Note

You can find information about distributing the configuration work across multiple engineering stations in the "Sharing out configuration work (Page 86)" section.

# Archiving

Do not forget to archive the overall project along with the individual projects on a regular basis via the SIMATIC Manager, especially where it is being worked on by multiple individuals.

Note

From PCS 7 V8.1, the "auto-archiving" function is available when downloading the program (with the optional package version trail).

# Master data library

Use a uniform master data library for the complete multiproject and ensure that all configuring engineers use the blocks, CMTs (control module types) and process tag types from this library.

# Multilingual capability

SIMATIC PCS 7 provides a large number of settings for texts and languages. The following application example provides a detailed description of how these are correctly configured, adapted, or amended:

- Configuration of Texts and Languages in SIMATIC PCS 7 (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/56248153)

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.1 General configuration rules

# Time synchronization

Time synchronization is critically important for the interrupt and tag logging system. Make sure that only one (redundant) time server is active in the running system and that all stations (PCs and CPUs) use the correct time. In PCS 7 V7.0 and above the CPU always uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

For information on time synchronization see the following manuals:

- "PCS 7 time synchronization"
- "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station"

# Special characters

When naming, it is generally recommended to not use any special characters (space % . ' \ ? * : § €) in names such as tag and archive names in PCS 7. Project names and image names may only contain ASCII characters.

The following chart shows additional characters which are not permitted for the components in PCS 7:

|Components|Illegal characters|
|---|---|
|Hierarchy folder|. " / \ %|
|Names for WinCC projects|. , ; : ! ? " ' + = / \ @ * % [ ] { } < > space|
|AS/OS connection names|. : ? " ' \ * % space|

The characters [ ‘ ] [ ' ] [ . ] [ % ] [ \ ] [ * ] [ ? ] [ : ] [ space ] within a name are converted into the substitute character [ $ ] when compiling the OS. The ES separator [ \ ] is converted to the [ / ] character.

# Example

If, for example, you assign the name "TICA:1" for a CFC chart (this becomes "TICA$1" on the OS) and use the name "TICA*1" for another CFC chart, (also becomes "TICA$1"), you will receive an error message with the OS compilation of the second chart because the chart name already exists.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.2 Required settings in the SIMATIC Manager

# Introduction

Before creating a multiproject, you should check the default settings of the SIMATIC Manager and adapt them to your requirements. The defaults settings can be edited in the SIMATIC Manager under "Options > Settings…". The online help is available in every dialog to provide you with an exact description of the optional settings. Practical settings which can make configuration work easier are listed below.

# General

Move the storage location for projects to a directory of a data partition.

# Language

Once the country language has been set you can determine whether the I/O address concept for the multiproject to be created should be based on German (e.g. AW512) or English (e.g. QW512).

# Archiving

Set both paths for archiving and retrieving to your chosen directory. The "PKZip" archiving program is the default setting for archiving a multiproject. You also need to set the "Archive spanning diskettes" option to "No" in the "Configure" dialog to shorten the archiving process.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

Message numbers

In PCS 7 V6.1 and above the "Assign CPU-oriented unique message numbers" option is the default setting. This ensures that S7 programs are copied without changes being made to the message numbers.

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

Division into individual projects for multiproject engineering

Dividing the multiproject into functional units is recommended in principle in PCS 7 (e.g. one project per unit). This setup provides the maximum flexibility during the configuration and commissioning phase. This applies in particular to automation systems (AS). This way the configuring engineer responsible for one or more automation systems (AS) can, for example, uncouple the appropriate project from the multiproject and configure this project separately.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 5.3 Creating the multiproject

The multiproject ("Comp_MP" in the following example) should consist of the following parts:

- Project "01_PLANT_A" for a unit consisting of fault-tolerant AS
- Project "02_PLANT_B" for a unit consisting of standard AS
- Project "25_ES" for one or more engineering stations
- Project "20_OS" for the redundant OS server pair and an OS client
- Project "21_CL", for OS clients of the same type as typical operator stations
- Master data library "Comp_Lib"

The division of the multiproject into various projects is determined by technological and local circumstances, as well as by specific project factors, such as the number of project engineers or the delineation of responsibilities.

Note

When PROFINET is used, it must be ensured when dividing the multiproject into individual projects that all stations that share a PROFINET network are in the same project. The functions of HW Config, e.g. topology configuration (automatic commissioning), can then be used.

You can find additional information on PROFINET in SIMATIC PCS 7 in the "PROFINET in SIMATIC PCS 7 – Guidelines and Blueprints" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/72887082) application example.

Note

A redundant OS server pair must always be created in the same project. Referenced operator stations must be created in the same project as the reference.

You can find detailed information on distributed engineering in the "PCS 7 Multiproject/Multi-user Engineering" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22258951) application example.

3. Change the project name "Comp_Prj" of plant A to "01_Plant_A".

Note

Project names for multiprojects and projects can be assigned freely. PCS 7 automatically specifies the file path to the storage location in the Windows file system. The path name may differ from the project name (shortened to eight characters). As PCS 7 data is only edited in the SIMATIC Manager, this path name is of no consequence to the user.

Check that the "Language of the display devices" setting is set uniformly across all projects for the entire multiproject. This setting is used to select the languages that are used for the OS configuration. This must be done before the first compilation of projects that contain an OS server so that the texts will be created in all languages on the OS.

To check the settings, select the respective project and then the "Language for Display Devices" command in the "Extras” menu.

The project "01_Plant_AS" has been created via the multiproject Wizard and therefore automatically contains the five PCS 7 standard languages. Only the relevant installation language is generally entered for new projects to be added.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.4 Adding additional projects

The "New Project" wizard has already generated the "Comp_Lib" master data library and added it to the project. It should contain all blocks, process tag types and CMTs (control module types) used in the project as a template.

Note

A central data management in the master data library is a prerequisite for essential PCS 7 functions such as the Import Export Assistant or the automatic block update for all S7 programs in the multiproject. When CMTs are used, the instantiated CMTs can be synchronized with the source type of the master data library.

Furthermore you can use the master data library to ensure that all project engineers are working on the same database. This facilitates coordination and organization during the configuration phase and during the later project expansions or upgrades.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.5 Adding Additional Stations

# 5.5.4 OS clients

# Introduction

By creating the stations in the project "20_OS" an OS client station has already been created which was renamed to "CLIENT01" in the previous section. This OS client can be configured and started accordingly in the later configuration stages. Furthermore the connection to OS servers already activated can also be tested. The OS clients for the plant operator are created later once the configuration is complete in the separate project "21_CL".

# Procedure

The following steps demonstrate how to create the station "CLIENT02":

1. Copy the completed station "CLIENT01" from project "20_OS" to project "21_CL" and rename it to "CLIENT02".
2. Rename the OS client project in the SIMATIC Manager as "CL02".
3. Enter the path for the target OS in the object properties. A shared folder with write access must be available on the target OS.

# Using OS reference clients

OS reference clients are always used when all settings on several OS clients are identical. Each configured OS client can be used as a basis for further clients. Creation and maintenance efforts along with the project scope for operator stations are reduced considerably as a result. In the example project, the stations "CLIENT03" and "CLIENT04" should be identical to station "CLIENT02".

1. For the number of identical clients configure a PC station for each with "WinCC Appl. Client Ref".
2. Configure the OS basis and the path to the target OS computer in the object properties of the OS project created within "WinCC Appl. Client Ref". A shared folder with write access must be available on the target OS.

3. Select the appropriate project from the existing OS client projects in the "OS Basis" field. The station "CLIENT03" is identical to station "CLIENT02" in project "Comp_MP". In this case the OS project "CL02" can be used as a basis for station "CLIENT03". The path to the target OS computer is set on the station "CLIENT03".

Note

If the settings for a referenced OS client change in relation to the base client, a new base client must be created. We do not recommend making changes on the OS client computer.

# 5.6 Creating the plant hierarchy

# Introduction

The individual stations have been added and the configuration of the automation system has been stored in the SIMATIC Manager component view. The plant view is used to portray the hierarchy of the process structure in the project.

One of the first and most important tasks in a project is defining the plant hierarchy (PH). The PH is the basis for the outward appearance of the OS runtime or for the integration of SIMATIC BATCH.

# Creating the PH

In the example project "Comp_MP" the PH of the AS projects is structured as shown below:

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA79

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.6 Creating the plant hierarchy

Create a PH in the "01_Plant_A" and "02_Plant_B" projects for the two automation systems. You can either create the individual hierarchy folders one by one or generate them automatically using a script file in the Import/Export Assistant (IEA).

Note the following rules:

- The plant designation (HID) is composed of a block name, CFC chart name and sometimes a hierarchy folder name. In principle the HID should be kept as short as possible. We recommend using CFC chart names (process tag name) that are unique throughout the project. Incorporation of the hierarchical folder names can be avoided in the HID (see section "Make PH settings"). If the plant naming convention is to be based on additional functional factors, the hierarchy folder names can still be integrated in the HID. The length of the HID should be limited to ensure that it can be fully displayed in all OS editing windows. The number of characters in the name of the hierarchy folders should not exceed this limit. Names with characters that exceed this limit will not be fully displayed in the HID.
- The following special characters may not be used in the name of a hierarchy folder: [ . ] [ % ] [ / ] [ \ ] [ " ].

# Making PH settings

1. Adapt the HID using the object properties of the PH by right-clicking on the multiproject and then selecting "Plant Hierarchy > Settings".

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.6 Creating the plant hierarchy

1. Select a subproject to serve as a template. In general, the PH settings should be uniform throughout the multiproject in PCS 7.
2. The number of hierarchy levels should remain set to 8, since for example the optional "Derive diagnostic screens from the plant hierarchy" asset management function can automatically generate up to 8 levels.
3. You can use the "OS area" option to determine the level from which the PH is displayed in the OS. The default setting is for the first level as in the example.
4. The "Derive picture hierarchy from the plant hierarchy" setting is activated by default in PCS 7. The advantage of this is that the OS picture hierarchy is fully derived from the configured PH during OS compilation and does not have to be configured and maintained separately.

The object properties of a hierarchy folder play an important role in this regard. Using the
"reactor1" folder as an example: On the "AS-OS Assignment" tab, assign the "reactor1"
folder an automation system as a technical plant from the component view. In this case the
charts from station "AS1_H" are assigned.

Each hierarchy folder then has an AS assigned as a technical plant, unit, or function in which
the charts run after being downloaded. All elements which you add to the hierarchy folder will
be assigned to this AS. If you transfer the selected assignments to lower-level objects, the
subordinate hierarchy folders adopt the same AS assignment. You can recognize this by the note
"All lower-level objects have the selected assignment."

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.7 Sharing out configuration work

# Introduction

Engineering management within a multiproject without any division of labor is a standard practice. However, if the goal is to shorten the configuration time by working in parallel, as of PCS 7 Version 7.0 SP1 the question of the most suitable method arises, because multi-user engineering has now been introduced as well as multiproject engineering.

# Multiproject engineering

For fast and flexible AS configuration, individual projects can be divided among distributed engineering stations. PCS 7 offers the appropriate system functions for managing, distributing and merging the projects. Projects can be separated from the multiproject in order for them to be processed on other engineering stations, e.g. in an office environment. Once they have been processed these projects are reintegrated into the central multiproject of the plant.

Note

You can find additional information in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual and in the "PCS 7 Multiproject / Multi-user Engineering" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22258951) application example.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.7 Sharing out configuration work

# Multi-user engineering

In addition to multiproject engineering, PCS 7 as of Version 7.0 SP1 also offers the possibility of working parallel on the same user program (CFC/SFC of an AS project). In this case the specific project can remain at its storage location. The multiproject is filed on the central engineering station. Using a Windows server operating system on the engineering server is recommended for performance reasons. The individual projects from multiple engineering stations are opened and processed via a network.

Note

In order for the required Sybase server to run on the central server computer, a user must be logged in on the central server computer. In order to remove this condition, you can set up the Sybase server as a service using the "setsybserv.exe" application. You can find extensive information on this in the section "This is how you prepare the engineering station for multi-user operation" in the "SIMATIC PCS 7 PC – Configuration" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109749317) manual.

Parallel working on a project via a combined network is restricted to CFC and SFC. Specific improvements were implemented in CFC and SFC, including failsafe functions to safeguard system integrity and data consistency when several users access the same data at the same time.

Starting with PCS 7 V8.1, when a CFC chart is opened, the user receives the message "Chart is being edited" if another editor has already opened this chart. From PCS 7 version V8.1 onwards, the OS station can be opened and edited remotely by all connected engineering stations. The individual editors or images can only be opened by one user simultaneously in each case. Sometimes a "read only" mode is also possible for looking at the configured data if editors are already opened.

# Creating and managing a PCS 7 project

# 5.8 System Registration – System ID

A new service concept was introduced with SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0, which is based on a system-specific system identification number – the System ID (SID).

The System ID is generated once when you register your new system for free at www.siemens.com/SIDregistry and is stored centrally at Siemens Technical Support. It then serves as the unique identification of your PCS 7 system over its entire life cycle.

The System ID is assigned to your PCS 7 multiproject by entering the System ID in the properties of the multiproject in SIMATIC Manager. The System ID entered there is also an integral component of the inventory data that you read out with the SIMATIC Management Console and can be sent to Siemens Technical Support via a Support Request.

Technical Support adds the transmitted inventory data and all the requests you make over the system's life cycle to your basic data. Registering your system offers you the following advantages:

- Faster and more targeted support saves you time and may shorten or prevent system stoppages.
- Holistic and fast error correction based on the current system configuration
- Lasting troubleshooting through documentation of all previous requests

Note

The "Determine inventory data" and "Export inventory data" functions of the SIMATIC Management Console can be used without a license starting in V9.0.

Note

You can find additional information on the System ID in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" manual.

# Configuration of the hardware (AS and I/O)

# Introduction

This section describes the settings in the hardware configuration (HW Config) of the example project ("Comp_MP").
The screenshots provide an overview of the properties of the following configurations:

- H-system with CPU 410-5H and CP 443-1/CP 443-5 Ext.
- Standard AS with a CPU 410-5H and CP 443-1/CP 443-5 Ext.

For other CPUs or CPs, the properties dialog boxes may differ slightly. Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:
S7-400 CPUs firmware version 5.1 and higher and Win AC RTX software version V4.6 and higher support dataset routing to the internal PROFIBUS DP interface.
For this purpose, the CPUs must also be configured in this firmware version. For all other S7-400 CPUs, the required routing functions must be implemented with a CP 443-5 Ext.

# 6.1 General CPU settings (H system and standard AS)

PCS 7 features optimized default settings for a CPU so that only a few parameters need to be set for a given project.
Detailed information on the parameters can be found in the HW Config online help. Special contexts for PCS 7 are explained in greater detail in the following sub-sections.
These subsections also contain relevant recommendations, the parameters to be left at their default settings, and the parameters you may need to adapt to your particular project.

CPU parameters highlighted in blue can be changed during operation on an H system. All special information for the CPU settings in the H system is given in the section titled "Special settings for an H system".
The following settings are made in the object properties of the CPU in HW Config.

The parameters relating to the CPU startup characteristics can be checked on the "Startup" tab. We recommend that you retain the default settings. This relates particularly to the enabled setting for "Warm restart." In this case, the current process parameters are not reset to their initial values. Another factor that plays a role in terms of startup characteristics is the fact that a PCS 7 AS is always equipped with a backup battery.

Scan cycle monitoring time

The scan cycle monitoring time should not be changed from the default value of '6000 ms' for PCS 7 projects to ensure the effectiveness of CPU performance monitoring and the emergency stop (shutdown prevention).

Size of the process image input/output

The size of the process image of the inputs/outputs depends on the I/O address space needed for the process signals. Adapt both values using the signal list from the plant planning where the default size set is not adequate. Factor in appropriate reserves where a standard AS is used and you wish to expand your plant while in operation. For H systems, the parameters highlighted in blue can be changed during operation. Note that when you adjust the values, the amount of usable work memory for code or data blocks changes.

Note

A process image with the size of 1000 I/O bytes takes up 12 KBytes in the work memory. 20 KBytes are taken up in CPU firmware V6 and above. You can see an overview of the I/O address space currently in use under the HW Config menu command "View > Address Overview…". The highest address for inputs or outputs listed (without diagnostic addresses) must be within the configured size of the process image. The process image is required for the PCS 7 configuration because all channel blocks access a symbolic address from the process image and do not work with direct I/O access.

# Configuration of the hardware (AS and I/O)

# 6.1 General CPU settings (H system and standard AS)

# 6.1.3 Process image partitions (PIP)

Using process image partitions

Note

The settings below are not required for fail-safe applications, as no process image partitions are used in them (see also "Compendium Part B - Process Safety).

The process image is generally updated by calling the OB1 (default setting). When process image partitions are used, they are updated by calling the respective associated cyclic interrupt OB.

As a rule, we recommend the use of process image partitions for PCS 7. Otherwise, "non-constant time response" will occur as a result of the free cycle of OB 1. This means that the process values are not processed and updated reliably in a temporal context. The graphic below is designed to illustrate this:

① If no process image partition is configured for OB 35 (the process image is updated in OB 1 only), OB 35 is executed three times with the "old" process values, without having direct influence on the process.

Configuration is performed in the following three steps:

1. CPU properties:

Assign one of up to 15 free process image partitions to a cyclic interrupt OB (e.g. OB 35 – 100 ms)
2. Module properties:

Assign the module addresses to a process image partition and thereby to the desired cyclic interrupt OB
3. CFC chart:

Installation of the channel blocks in the cyclic interrupt OB which belongs to the process image partition

The process image partition is automatically updated by the cyclic interrupt OB to which it was assigned.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the hardware (AS and I/O)

This ensures that the inputs really are read at the start of a cyclic interrupt OB (for example, a controller is processed) and also that the outputs are written in accordance with the cycle (input – process – output: IPO).

① = Process image partition PIPx

Note

You can find background information about the relationship between process images and process image partitions in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual, in the section "Setting the process image".

# 6.1 General CPU settings (H system and standard AS)

# "Process image partition" column

You have the option of selecting a separate process image partition for each cyclic interrupt used in order to guarantee a consistent signal update with the CPU at full load.

# "Priority" and "Phase offset" columns

The "Priority" column should not be changed for standard applications. With several cyclic interrupt OBs that are to be called at the same time, we recommend setting a phase offset for OBs with lower priority. For example, OB 38 to OB 32 are called in sequence at 1,000 ms. The execution time of the cyclic interrupts can be distributed beyond the cycle using the phase offset. The table below shows the parameter assignments for the example:

|Cyclic interrupt OB|Execution (processing portion)|Phase offset|
|---|---|---|
|OB 32|1000 ms (150 ms)|100 ms (>70+20)|
|OB 33|500 ms (70 ms)|30 ms (>20)|
|OB 34|200 ms (20 ms)|0|

# 6.1.5 Memory

Local data (priority classes)

Local data is derived from the declaration section of the logic blocks and stored centrally in the local data storage area. On the "Memory" tab, you can define the local data size in the work memory for each individual OB. This value must always be beyond the particular local data requirement.

Each cyclic interrupt OB is assigned a local data size by means of its priority. OB 30, for example, has the priority 7 and OB 38 the priority 15. The default setting is 2048 bytes for each cyclic interrupt OB which is adequate for typical quantities of block types. As early as the engineering phase, a check is made when compiling charts to determine whether a warning threshold (preset to 90%) is exceeded.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuration of the hardware (AS and I/O)

# 6.1 General CPU settings (H system and standard AS)

If the warning threshold is exceeded due to import of new block types in complex processes, increase the maximum size of the local data area (preset to 65536 for CPU 410-5H) and then increase the local data of the priority classes used.

It is also important to set the priorities 24 to 28 to a value of 2048. These contain OB 100 and the asynchronous error OBs.

Checking the local data requirement

Use the CFC editor to compare the local data requirement and amount in the CPU. Use the "Options > Chart > Chart Reference Data" command to open the editor in which the "Local Data" can be viewed. An OB configured too low is shown in red in this view.

The maximum amount of local data is CPU-dependent, e.g. 65536 bytes for CPU 410-5H.

# Communication resources

The CPU also determines the maximum number of possible communication jobs. A CPU 410-5H can, for example, manage a maximum of 10,000 communication jobs. Block instances of, for example, BSEND, BRCV, ALARM, ALARM_8, ALARM_8P, NOTIFY and AR_SEND occupy one communication job each.

A process object or its function block (FB) typically occupies up to 3 communication jobs per instance.

With this CPU the default setting is for 10000 communication jobs which is adequate for typical quantities of block instances. A check is made when compiling the charts during the engineering phase as to whether a warning threshold has been crossed (with a default setting of 90%).

Note

Adjust the warning level according to the planned number of PO for a CPU. Set the warning level of 2,500 communication jobs (factor 2.5) taking the example of the CPU 410-5H with System Expansion Card 1000 PO. Select the chart folder of the automation system to determine the currently used communication jobs. Via "Extras > Charts > Chart reference data", you can open the relevant program where you will find the "Statistics" view with the number of communication jobs.

# 6.1.6 Diagnostics/clock

Time synchronization

For process data to be compatible for evaluation, all components of the process control system must work with the same time of day so that messages – regardless of the time zone in which they are generated – can be assigned correctly in terms of temporal sequence. This usually involves an OS server or an external time-of-day master ("SICLOCK" central plant clock) taking on the role of the time master. All other operator stations and automation systems on the plant bus then have the time from this master and, therefore, identical time. As a result the synchronization type is set to: "As slave" for each AS in a time-synchronized PCS 7 plant in the SIMATIC mode.

Activate time synchronization in the CPU from the "Diagnostics/Clock" tab. Set the CPUs of the automation systems to function as time slaves. They receive the time from the active time master on the plant bus.

Note

For the S7-400 CPU PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface, the information on configuring in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Time Synchronization" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual, in the "How to set time synchronization on an AS for NTP mode" section applies.

# Acknowledgment-triggered reporting (ATR)

With the "Acknowledgment-triggered reporting of SFB 33-35" option, it is possible to suppress the repeated reporting of "fluttering" signals, until an acknowledgment has been issued. This can help to make the message list clearer, as well as to take some of the strain off the communication system.

However, we recommend that you leave ATR deactivated, for the following reasons:

- It can cause the plant operator to stop acknowledging messages, even those which are not "fluttering messages". If this is the case, the operator will not realize that the event causing the message is recurring.
- The ATR property is a property of the CPU, which must be explicitly set for each CPU. If this property is not set to the same value for all CPUs, this can result in varying message behavior for the operator.
- The ALARM (SFB 33), ALARM_8 (SFB 34), and ALARM_8P (SFB 35) blocks then only report a change of signal if the previous change of signal (the previous incoming message) has been acknowledged. This property applies to all signals on these blocks, irrespective of the "Acknowledgment required" property in PCS 7.
- The setting can only be subsequently changed by performing a complete CPU download.
- "Fluttering messages" which appear during commissioning or when a process tag is faulty can also be blocked using the "Acknowledge error" OS function.

# 6.2 Special settings for H systems

The following images shows the default settings on the "H Parameters" tab:

# Parameters for the advanced CPU test

"Reaction to RAM/PAA comparison error" should remain set to the "TROUBLESHOOTING" operating mode. The H CPU offers a function for detecting a memory error, fixing simple memory errors, and automatically returning to the "RUN redundant" system mode.

# Update of the reserve

The reserve CPU is updated each time an H system goes from the "RUN solo mode" to "RUN redundant" system mode. This process is often referred to as "link-up and update". In the link-up phase, the CPU in RUN copies all blocks to the stopped CPU. In the update phase, the data block values that have changed since copying are updated.

Note

You can find detailed information about link-up and update in the following manuals:

- CPU 410H "SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748473)"

# 6.2 Special settings for H systems

Calculating monitoring times for updating the reserve CPU

To avoid influencing the ongoing process during the critical update phase, four monitoring times are provided that can cancel the update phase where a monitoring time is exceeded. A dialog box is opened via the "Calculate" button where the monitoring times are calculated using the hardware configuration and the information on the user program. The minimum I/O retention time always stems from the quantity of DP slaves configured. For PROFINET the minimum I/O retention time corresponds to the largest watchdog time. Information on the user program is described in the online help.

Note

The default user program value settings (0,0,1024) provide the default monitoring times (8,000 ms, 3,200 ms, 800 ms, 70 ms). These values are already optimized for typical user cases meaning that no new calculation is required. In the event that monitoring times which are set too low prevent redundant operation during a plant conversion (e.g. through configured DP slaves that cannot be reached, the update will take longer than 800 ms), the times can be increased and updated during operation.

# Configuration of the hardware (AS and I/O)

# 6.2 Special settings for H systems

Ascertain the length of time for the monitoring time taken when updating. The period for the update phase for transition to redundant operation is adhered to each time in the CPU diagnostics buffer. Look for the following event for this:

- Event 7 of 3000
- Event ID 16# 7303
- H system (1of2) gone into redundant operation
- Occurred in: Master CPU in rack no.: 0
- Start-up information:
- Start with no change in system expansion
- Update monitoring time in ms: 426

In order for the H system to transition to redundant operation the monitoring time displayed for updating must be less than the maximum inhibit time for priority classes >15.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

NTP mode

S7-400 standard CPUs PN I/O with integrated Ethernet interface (FW &lt; V7) can only be synchronized using NTP. The H-CPUs in FW V6 and above support both NTP as well as SIMATIC mode.

NTP mode is not yet supported by all PCS 7 components. As a result, both modes must be used simultaneously in order to perform time synchronization with the IE bundles. If both time servers are operated on a single PC, poor priority settings can lead to a time offset. A remedy for this is the use of a SICLOCK TC400 central system clock, which supports both modes.

An NTP server such as a SICLOCK or a PC is required to synchronize the time of the S7-400IE. It forwards only the pure GMT time without time zone information to the connected NTP clients.

Note

You can find more information about configuration in the "PCS 7 Time Synchronization" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544) manual.

# 6.4 Settings for CP 443-5 Ext as PROFIBUS master

Introduction

A separate DP master system is needed for each PROFIBUS DP segment in PCS 7. With the internal DP interface of the CPU410-5H, a PROFIBUS network can already be integrated without an additional CP. For each additional PROFIBUS network, one CP 443-5 Ext each is added to the rack.

Two PROFIBUS masters in each case from both racks form a redundant master system in H systems.

The settings shown below apply to both H-systems and standard systems.

Note the following when using SIMATIC PDM in the project:

- The integrated DP interfaces of a S7-400 CPU also support the "Data Record Routing" function in configured firmware version V5.1 and above, and can therefore also be used as a fully-fledged DP master. For all CPUs with lower firmware versions the "Data Record Routing" function must be established with a CP 443-5 Extended.

4. You can make the network settings for each PROFIBUS network. The default profile "DP" is suitable for most applications, e.g. networks in line structures. A user-defined profile is required depending on the DP slaves used or the use of optical rings via PROFIBUS OLM. Set the transmission rate depending on the connected DP slaves and the length of the PROFIBUS segment. The default transmission speed of 1.5 Mbps can be adjusted in individual cases.

5. Use the "Options" and "Take into account the following cable configuration" buttons to add your bus architecture to the configuration and thereby optimize the DP bus parameters for your process.

# Naming concept

The names of IO devices and DP slaves should be based on the naming concept of a plant or plant network to allow you to quickly localize the location of a problem during maintenance. Industry-neutral as well as industry-specific names exist for this.

Industry-neutral example: 2550C01CA04

- 25: Short designation of the production facility
- 50: Name of the control room
- C01C: Name and position of the rack
- A04: Module slot

Industry-specific example based on the water industry: RN-LISA-04

Adhere to the following convention for the names of the individual process tags:

XXN_XXXX_XX

- XXN: Process step
- XXXX: Measuring principle:
- XX: Element

According to the ATV260 guideline, the name of the process step must be shortened to two characters, e.g. RB for rain overflow basin. The character "N" is optional, if several identically named process steps exist.

The name of the process tag type is formed according to EN 62424. In the following using the example of LISA (Level, Indication, binary switching function, Alarm) for the level measurement including indication, alarm information and a switching function.

With this name concept, if an error occurs, e.g. in the DP subnet, a message containing information about the position of the slave is generated on the OS.

# Note

The following naming conventions apply to all components in HW Config:

- The name should not exceed 14 characters. When generating the module drivers (CFC compilation), the names from HW Config are used for the CFC block instances. CFC blocks can have a maximum of 16 characters. The module driver wizard shortens the name from HW Config to 14 characters and adds "_1" to "99" in ascending order.
- Make sure that the assigned names are unique. Upper and lower case letters are not a distinguishing feature and are not taken into account when the OS compiled.

# 6.6.4 General rules for configuring I/O modules

Introduction

In general, a channel of a module is activated only after connection of the corresponding actuator, sensor or equivalent resistance. Unnecessary diagnostic messages are thus prevented in the PCS 7 OS during runtime.

For some modules, channels are combined into channel groups, e.g. the AI8x12Bit module with 8 channels is composed of 4 channel groups with 2 channels per channel group. In this case, a group is activated as soon as one of the two channels is connected to a signal. At least one equivalent resistance must also be connected in this case.

Analog input (6ES7331-7KF02-0AB0 in the example)

The measuring type depends on whether a transducer which is supplied with power by the module (2-wire transducer) is operated on the AI module, or whether the transducer receives its power from an external supply (4-wire transducer).

The setting of the measuring range module is displayed according to the configuration. This setting must be suitable for the connected sensors and must be in place before voltage is applied for the first time in order to avoid damaging the module.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 6.6 Configuration of the I/O devices

Placing the "diagnostics interrupt" check mark in the "release" field effects the generation of messages by the PCS 7 driver block "MOD_D1".

Note

For a description of the "MOD_D1" driver block including the available messages, see the "Process Control System PCS 7 Basis Library" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual.

You should deactivate the "Hardware interrupt at limit violation" option. This is realized in PCS 7 with the channel block functionality in the charts.

# Analog output (6ES7332-5HD01-0AB0 in the example)

You need to configure how the outputs are to respond to a CPU STOP. In this example, the outputs have no current or voltage (OCV setting).

Note

You must set the channel-specific setting "Reaction to CPU STOP" (OCV - No Output Current or Voltage, KLV - Keep Last Value and USV - Use Substitute Value) of a module (e.g. analog output with 4 channels) the same for all channels within the ET 200M distributed I/O.

# 6.6 Configuration of the I/O devices

Process image partition (PIP)

Assign the process image partition to an I/O module you have previously defined in the CPU properties for a cyclic interrupt OB (see the section titled "Assigning parameters for process image partitions"). This step synchronizes the I/O values or signals of this module with the process image in the CPU before and after the cyclic interrupt OB.

To do this, open the properties of the module and the "Addresses" tab and set the desired process image partition (TPA1 in this case). The process image partition is therefore assigned for all I/O values or signals of this module.

Note

It is generally practical to initially assign all modules to a medium program cycle (e.g. 500 ms or 1,000 ms) for a complete process consisting of a few fast and slow parts. Then, you only assign the appropriate process image partition of the cyclic interrupt involved to the modules containing the signals for fast control loops or interlocks (e.g. 50 ms or 100 ms).

This procedure saves you configuring time.

# 6.7 Plant changes during operation

# Introduction

With CiR (Configuration in RUN) it is possible to make certain hardware configuration changes in RUN mode. Typical reasons for doing this include the complexity of the automated process and high restart costs.
The Configuration in RUN function is available for use on PROFIBUS DP and PROFINET. For Configuration in Run (CiR) on PROFINET, CPU 410 Firmware V8.2 or higher is required.

# 6.7.1 Configuration in Run on PROFIBUS DP

In the case of standard automation systems and PROFIBUS DP, Configuration in Run (CiR) is available only after activation of the function in HW Config and a one-time download of the AS in STOP.

# Procedure

1. To activate CiR in HW Config, right-click on the subnet (DP master system) and select "Activate CiR capability" from the shortcut menu. This attaches a CiR object to the respective master system. It offers the possibility of configuring an adjustable number of DP slaves in the future and downloading the changes without a CPU STOP. Each existing DP slave automatically receives an orange colored title as a sign that it can be changed.

1. Adapt the object properties of the CiR object to your plans. If the guaranteed number of additional DP slaves has been exhausted then a planned STOP of the AS can be used to increase the number and to activate through a complete download.
2. When CiR is activated, you have a CiR module in the first free slot within ET 200M and ET 200SP. It offers the possibility of configuring and loading an adjustable number of modules in the future. Adapt the object properties of the CiR modules to your plans.
3. After activating CiR and checking the CiR settings in the CiR objects and CiR modules, save and compile the hardware configuration and download it to the automation system in the STOP operating mode. Following this you can run the "Download in RUN mode" function in HW Config.

# Changes to the hardware configuration of an H-system

The CiR functionality described above is available in the H system without any special settings. There are no CiR objects or CiR modules in the H system and the function does not need to be explicitly activated. You can use the "Download in RUN mode" function immediately. This opens an additional dialog, in which you can start the tasks required for changing the configuration.

In addition, all parameters marked in blue in the CPU properties dialog can be modified in RUN.

Note

You can find a detailed description of the possible hardware changes with CiR on PROFIBUS DP in the following manuals:

- "SIMATIC PCS 7 Process Control System CPU 410 Process Automation"
- "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System"

# 6.7.2 Configuration in Run on PROFINET

A prerequisite for the "Configuration in Run" function (CiR) on PROFINET is the use of CPU 410 Firmware V8.2 or higher and PCS 7 V9.0 or higher. The scope of the "Configuration in Run" function is different for standard automation systems (CiR) and H-systems (H-CiR). In contrast to PROFIBUS DP, no CiR objects are needed for CiR/H-CiR on PROFINET and no address spaces have to be reserved.

Which changes are possible as a CiR/H-CiR operation is dependent on whether the utilized (changed) IO device supports CiR functionality.

|CiR/ H-CiR operation|Device without CiR|Device with CiR|
|---|---|---|
|Adding IO device|✓|✓|
|Removing IO device|✓|✓|
|Adding submodule|x|✓|
|Removing submodule|x|✓|
|Reassigning submodule parameters|x|✓|
|Interface parameter assignment|x|✓|

Changes to the hardware configuration of a standard AS

When CiR is used in a standard automation system, processing is stopped briefly for the download operation (CiR synchronization time). During this time, process inputs and outputs keep their last value. When the CPU 410-5H is used, the maximum CiR synchronization time is 60 ms.

Integrating field devices

The configuring of field devices is divided into two steps: configuration and parameter assignment.

The following image provides an overview of the ways in which a device can be integrated in PCS 7. In principle, all PROFIBUS DP, PROFIBUS PA, HART, and Foundation Fieldbus (FF) devices can be integrated in PCS 7 (as of PCS 7 V7.0).

# Integration via the object manager

The object manager is available for many SIEMENS devices, such as the ET 200M. In this
case, the correct terminology is "S7 slave". The project engineering for an S7 slave is
performed via the dedicated STEP 7 object manager. Both the configuration and parameter
assignment are executed in HW Config.

# Integration via the generic station description (GSD) as a standard slave

Field devices made by any manufacturer can be integrated via the standard GSD file
(standard slaves). This type of integration is used for PROFIBUS DP, PROFIBUS PA, FF
and HART devices. The configuration is set in HW Config. The default parameter
assignment for the device is also pre-defined in the GSD. Parameter adjustments must then
be made using a proprietary tool; alternatively, in the case of devices with EDD (Electronic
Device Description) the adaptations can be made using SIMATIC PDM.

Data can only be exchanged between the master and a field device if the master is aware of
the device-specific parameters and data formats. The field device manufacturer supplies this
"knowledge" in the form of a GSD file.

GSD files contain information about:

- Device manufacturer and identification number
- Transmission rate and bus parameters
- Volume and format of data for cyclic communication

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 6.8 Integrating field devices

In HW Config in the object properties of a device you can determine which revision level of the GSD is installed and used. For this right-click on the device after positioning the device and select "Object properties" in the context menu.

For S7 slaves which are integrated via the object manager, no GSD file is specified here. You can occasionally procure a later GSD for a field device from the field device manufacturer. This GSD can be easily installed.

To install a GSD:

1. Open HW Config.
2. Close all open projects.

# Configuration of the hardware (AS and I/O)

# 6.8 Integrating field devices

1. Select the "Install GSD File" command from the "Options" menu.
2. Select the GSD directory and install the selected GSD.

Note

If a new device for which parameters are to be assigned using SIMATIC PDM is integrated, the GSD and EDD files of the device must be imported using the "Device Integration Manager" PDM application.

# Assigning parameters using the SIMATIC Process Device Manager and EDD file

SIMATIC PDM can be used to assign the parameters for a field device (made by any manufacturer). The EDD (Electronic Device Description) provides the basic information such as device-specific parameters and information on acyclic communication.

The description language EDDL (Electronic Device Description Language) is used to generate EDDs; this is also standardized in the IEC standard (IEC 61804).

This language can be used universally and facilitates the creation of cross-vendor device descriptions for field devices (sensors and actuators).

The device manufacturer provides the relevant descriptions for each device in electronic format. The EDD files describe the parameters and functions of a device and also contain elements used for operation and visualization.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 6.8 Integrating field devices

Once SIMATIC PDM has been opened, on the "Device" tab found under “Device > Object Properties" you can define the storage folder and revision level of the EDD file corresponding to the device.

You can occasionally procure later EDDs for field devices from the field device manufacturer. The EDDs can be conveniently imported through the "SIMATIC PDM/Device Integration Manager".

An EDD device description may contain the following components:

- Device description (EDD file)
- Lexicon/user languages
- Help files (relating to function and operation)
- Manuals (technical documentation)
- Communication description (GSD file)
- Images / graphics

# Diagnostic support for field devices

PCS 7 automatically creates diagnostics drivers with the help of the module wizard for HART devices, PA devices with profile 3.0 and above, FF devices, PROFIBUS DP standard slaves and released modules.

Various add-ons are also supported, such as SIMOCODE PRO and DRIVE ES. When installed, these add-ons provide the action lists required to automatically create diagnostics drivers.

Diagnostics drivers can also be configured manually, but they must be created separately from the system charts.

Redundant interface

DP devices which have access to a redundant interface are always configured and connected redundantly (e.g. ET 200M, ET 200iSP). DP devices which do not have access to a redundant interface are connected downstream of the Y link. The number of field devices which can be configured downstream of the Y link is restricted here by the I/O range of 244 bytes that applies in each case. PA devices are always connected redundantly downstream of a DP/PA link.

Variables which restrict the number of permissible devices per DP/PA link, with a redundant and a non-redundant connection:

- Feeding current of the DP/PA coupler (110 mA EX or 1,000 mA non-EX)
- Current consumption of the field devices (typically 12 mA)
- Address range of the field devices (max. 244 bytes of I/O data, 5 bytes per analog value)
- Cycle time on the PROFIBUS PA (if specific customer requirements need to be met)

Information on configuring Y-Link and DP/PA Link can be found in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Extended fieldbus diagnostics (EFD system)

The extended field bus diagnostics (EFD system) determines the physical data of the PROFIBUS PA bus segment via the Compact Field Unit PA or the installed coupler and active field distributor. This information can be retrieved in the Maintenance Station or SIMATIC PDM.

A further advantage of the EFD system is the commissioning wizard, which can individually activate (up to 6) spur lines of the AFDiSD one after another. This is makes it possible, for example, to connect several PROFIBUS PA devices with the same PA address (e.g., default address 126) at the same time without having to change the address beforehand.

You can use the following components to implement the extended fieldbus diagnostics on PROFIBUS DP segments:

- Interface module (IM 153-2 (Outdoor) 6ES7 153-2BA70-0AB0)
- Coupler (FDC 157)
- Field distributors (AFDiSD)

On PROFINET segments the Compact Field Unit PA supports the extended fieldbus diagnostics for connected PROFIBUS PA devices.

Note

# Configuration of the network connections

# Introduction

After the stations are fitted and configured, the connections between the ES/OS server and the automation systems, as well as the connections between the automation systems themselves, are configured and downloaded to the individual stations.

The CPs of the relevant stations must be connected to the plant bus for these connections to be loaded. The ISO protocol is used for process communication.

The OS clients are also connected to the terminal bus like the OS servers. The terminal bus is not configured in PCS 7 as it is already configured in full via the Windows control panel.

# Configuration of the network connections

A ring structure made up of SCALANCE switches is recommended for the plant bus or terminal bus; optionally also in a redundant design. For the ring structure a switch is set up as the redundancy manager (RM) in redundancy mode (HRP Manager). The remaining switches must support the ring redundancy as nodes and be configured as the HRP client in redundancy mode.

Note

Connecting redundant stations to the bus via 2 different switches is recommended in order to guarantee the availability of the plant (affects H systems as well as a redundant OS server pair).

The mandatory and optional settings for SCALANCE switches are described in the corresponding manual. The available Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP) setting is only permitted on the fieldbus in PCS 7.

# NetPro view

In the NetPro view the following network structure for the project "01_Plant_A" with the H system is presented as the result of the existing configuration. The station's orange color denotes pending changes that have not yet been compiled. Once the configuration described in this section has been completed in NetPro, all stations in the multiproject must be represented by an error-free compilation in white before the configuration is loaded into the automation systems. With a station-selective configuration, as in this example, the networks (subnets) of the individual subprojects must also be merged.

High availability communication (2 paths or 4 paths)

A "S7 connection fault-tolerant" is always used for communication between fault-tolerant systems. The following connection partners are possible:

- For a simple plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 1x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x CP 443-1
- PC station with C16xx
- For a redundant plant bus:
- Standard AS with CPU 41xH, and 2x CP 443-1 if required
- H system with 2x or 4x CP 443-1
- PC station with 2x CP16xx

# Communication between H systems and standard AS

Note

Fault-tolerant AS-AS communication is not possible between fault-tolerant systems and standard systems in PCS 7 as standard, meaning that AS-wide interconnections also cannot be used.

You can instead create two standard S7 connections and then realize the fault-tolerance as an application-specific block solution. The following provide the options for this:

- Industry-Library (ASSendH and ASRecvH)
- Library S7H4_BSR (also for older PCS 7 versions)

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

Introduction

Plant engineering gives rise to plant parts, functions or program sections which only differ from one another in a few respects. In the interests of working efficiently, create basic elements which can be reused repeatedly and which only have to be supplied with the current parameters. Once created these are managed in the master data library and used as an instance or replica in the AS assigned.

Note

All the information on configuring the AS functions can be found in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" manual, from the "Basic Engineering Concepts" section.

Further information can also be found in the "Technical Functions for the Chemical Industry" application.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.1 Master data library

Adoption of existing base elements in the master data library

The following are available in PCS 7 as base elements for the purposes of reuse as an instance:

- Block type
Also referred below as a block.
- SFC type
- Process tag type
As an interface for the Import/Export Assistant
- Model
Models from completed hierarchy folder consisting of process tag types and of one or more process images
- Control module type (CMT)
Starting with PCS 7 V8.0 the type concept based on control module types is available. The control module type is referred to as CMT below. CMTs serve as an interface for the Plant Automatic Accelerator.

Note
The complete description of the base elements and their use can be found in the "Typing, reuse and central changeability of engineering data" section in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" manual.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

Copy all required base elements from all libraries used for the configuration (e.g. PCS 7 AP Library) to the master data library of the multiproject ("Comp_LIB" in this case). In the event that individual blocks should have changed attributes or names through the copying process then the following message is received. Calling up the "Synchronize attributes" function is recommended in this event so that no project-specific changes are lost in the master data library.

Note

When copying blocks observe the rules and notes in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual. Ensure that blocks are also copied that are opened as a multi-instance from other blocks, as the function of the block is not ensured otherwise.

# 8.1.2 Creating user-defined technological blocks

# Block library

In PCS 7, user-specific blocks can be created quite easily, meaning that particular customer requirements can be met in a very flexible way. A user-defined block has a faceplate and its block icon for operating and monitoring the OS.

Be sure to always factor in the corresponding expertise, time and effort for the creation, maintenance and upkeep of your own blocks. Working with existing PCS 7 block libraries is recommended with this. A major advantage with the existing library blocks is the fact that they are serviced and maintained systematically, including with regard to different PCS 7 versions. Project teams can save time and cost as a result, particularly for future upgrades where the original project team may no longer be available.

# Criteria to consider when making decisions about creating user-defined blocks

The following points must be reviewed before creating user-defined blocks:

- What functions do any existing PCS 7 block libraries offer (e.g. PCS 7 add-on catalog) in terms of meeting your requirements?
- Does a sector-specific library already exist that covers your requirements?
- Can an existing PCS 7 block library be adapted to meet your requirements, e.g. related to the display?
- Is just one block to be created, or several blocks?
- Is there a description or specification of the functions required of the blocks to be created?
- Can user-defined blocks be maintained and serviced in the future?

# Guidelines on the range of numbers

The block number range for AS blocks 0 to 2499 is already allocated for the standard, add-on and sector-specific libraries. The FB range of numbers is therefore divided up as follows:

- Up to FB1000: Allocated with existing PCS 7 block libraries
- FB 1800-1999: Reserved for the PCS 7 system
- FB 1025 and above: Provided for SFC types
- FB 2000- 2014: Allocation for the SIMOCODE Pro library

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

To avoid any conflicts with the number ranges of existing AS blocks, assign block numbers starting from 2500 when creating your own blocks.

Note

Please note that the following CPU types do not support a block range of numbers greater than 2048:

- CPUs 412-416 with V4.x version
- H-CPU 412 and 414 with V4.x version

Numbers in the range from 1200 to 1249 are recommended when using user-defined blocks on these CPU types.

# Guidelines on naming

The system has a limit of 16 characters for symbolic names for function blocks. However, a maximum of 8 characters is recommended on account of the display in the CFC Editor. Symbolic names with more than 8 characters are not displayed in full in the CFC Editor for summary reasons.

When determining symbolic names the first characters should be allocated with the block names in order to allow the function blocks to be uniquely assigned during the configuration phase. If you want to expand a symbolic name with additional information (e.g. company abbreviation) then place this at the end of the symbolic name.

The following example illustrates the naming guidelines:

- Block name: "CountOh"
- Symbolic name: "CountOh_Siemens"
- Display in the CFC Editor: "CountOh_"

# Guidelines on creation

The "Compile chart as FB" function should not be used when using APL blocks to create user-defined blocks as the "S7_x" attributes are not supported for structures. S7 SCL is provided for creating the blocks in this case.

Note

You can find detailed information on creating technological blocks according to the PCS 7 guidelines in the "PCS 7 - Programming Instructions for Blocks" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/24449702) manual.

# 8.1.3 Creating user-defined driver blocks

Using driver blocks

Similar to the creation of technological blocks, you can also create driver blocks for non-integrated modules/devices with PCS 7. A driver block evaluates the status or the diagnostics for the modules/devices. Accordingly, a separate channel block is generally required for the actual signal processing.

The main objective of creating driver blocks is to achieve integration in the hierarchical driver concept of PCS 7. The hierarchical driver concept has been implemented in the PCS 7 Basic library and forms a basis for asset management.

You can change the message class, priority, and message text for all function blocks.

Note

Please take note of the "Aspects of Message Configuration" table in this regard in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" manual.

The appearance of limit violations at the block can be influenced in process control in group displays and in message lists. The "User-configurable message classes" function is available for this purpose.

Introduction

You can change the attributes of any function block. For example, attribute "S7_m_c = true" means that the block/block I/O will be created as a structure/tag in the OS project by the OS compilation.

Procedure

Set the attributes in the properties dialog of a block I/O on the appropriate tab.

Note

First add the changes to the master data library so that the blocks in the S7 programs of the AS subprojects can be updated later (see also section: Updating block types (Page 174)). A delta download of the automation systems is still possible following changes to parameter attributes. You may need to compile and download the OS servers if you make changes to the block attributes.

Type updating in RUN (TCiR, Type Change in RUN)

In connection with the CPU 410 (firmware V8.1 or higher) and PCS 7 version (V8.1 or higher), a type update in RUN mode is supported. This makes it possible to update the instances and download them to the CPU in RUN mode after changing an interface at the block types.

Note

You can find further information on the subject of "Type updating in RUN" in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 CFC for SIMATIC S7" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748700) manual and in the "Process automation with the SIMATIC PCS 7 CPU 410-5H controller" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/96839331) application example.

# 8.1.7 Driver concept

# General principle

Driver blocks act as an interface between the I/O modules, PI devices and the S7 program. Input/output signals and status information (e.g. wire break), which can then be used in the CFC editor, are made available via the driver blocks. "Signal value invalid" (QBAD) and "Value status of the signal" (Quality) are available on the channel driver.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

PCS 7 features channel blocks for the actual signal and diagnostic blocks for diagnosing the subnet, racks, and modules. The channel blocks must be configured in CFC.

Define symbolic names for each channel in the hardware configuration (e.g. H4711GO). Linking a driver block to this symbolic name assigns this I/O signal to the signal driver. The diagnostic blocks are automatically created by the system in the charts (@Charts) when the CFC charts are compiled.

Parameters are already assigned automatically to the diagnostic blocks in accordance with the settings made in the hardware configuration.

If an entire ET 200M fails, for example, a process control message is provided pointing to the faulty ET 200M. The individual process control messages of the modules and their channels are automatically suppressed. This prevents a message burst from occurring, thus making troubleshooting easier. The relevant technological messages continue to be evaluated.

Note

The diagnostic blocks from the charts (@Charts) are described in the "SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Basis Library" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual in the “Family: @System” section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Advanced Process Library are described in the "SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Advanced Process Library" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482346) manual in the "Channel Blocks" section. The channel blocks of the PCS 7 Library V7.1 are described in the "SIMATIC process control system PCS 7 Standard Library" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/36201733) function manual in the "Family: DRIVER" section.

# Diagnostic block "CPU_RT"

Starting with PCS 7 V7.0, the @CPU_RT chart with the "CPU_RT" diagnostic block is automatically created when the CFC is compiled. Channel/diagnostic blocks in PCS 7 Library V7.0 and above must be used for this.

The "CPU_RT" diagnostic block implements a new controller and cycle behavior in the overload range. All automation systems have the new behavior in the overload range. A performance analysis of the AS load is also possible. The performance analysis depends on the CPU firmware (CPU FW V4.5 and above). If the CPU FW supports SFC 78, the performance data can be read via "CPU_RT". The performance data is shown in the diagnostic area of PCS 7 asset management (see also the "Integrated asset management (Page 310)" section).

Note

You can find additional information on "CPU_RT" in the "Family: @System" section of the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Basic Library" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748664) manual.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.1 Principles

# 8.1.8 AS resource utilization

Cycle load

It is advisable to always determine the cycle load of the AS during the engineering phase. If the actual cycle load surpasses the results from the planning tools, such as PCS 7 ProTime, corresponding adjustments are needed in the affected AS.

You can do this in the following ways:

- Using the "CPU_RT" block in PCS 7 V7.0 and above and the corresponding AS (FW > V4.5). Information on FW can be found in the "Driver concept (Page 176)" section.
- For an older AS (FW < V4.5) you can configure determination of the cycle load and download it to the AS in RUN mode at any time using CFC blocks.

Note

You can find additional information in FAQ "How can you calculate the cycle load of the automation system (AS) online?" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/22000962).

Typical limits for the cycle load after commissioning the AS:

Observe the TOTALAV I/O of the "CPU_RT" block (total average value of all OB 1, OB 3x, OB 8x (in %). This value should never be above 75%, regardless of whether it involves a standard AS or an H system. This corresponds with the default limit on the MAXLIM I/O with which the "Net time consumption of all OBs exceeds Max Limit" is produced.

Peaks may occur through additional process loads, e.g. triggered by asynchronous OB errors, which may also cause time errors with a basic load of more than 75%. This leads to OB 80 being called up with a process control message included and results in the following entry in the CPU diagnostic buffer:

"Event ID 16# 3502 OB request error / Causing OB: Time error OB (OB 80)".

Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements:

The net time usage of all OBs must not exceed 75% on average.

After completion of the engineering phase, check the CPU diagnostic buffer for OB 80 entries. Where there are entries present reduce the cycle load of the relevant cyclic interrupt OBs.

# Memory load

Current memory utilization for the work memory and the load memory can be ascertained in the online module status of the CPU. The warning threshold for the work memory and the load memory is 90% by default. This threshold can be changed in the CFC Editor.

Note

When changes are downloaded frequently, it is recommended that the assigned work memory code not exceed 80%. Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements: The assigned work memory code must not exceed 80%.

# Communication utilization

The following recommendations for communication between two PCS 7-AS can be deduced from the rules on configuring AS-wide interconnections in the CFC online help:

- AS-wide interconnections can be used for configuration in PCS 7 V7.1 and above. The advantage with this is that the quantity structures are checked automatically upon compilation and are captured in the CFC reference data.
- Configurations with the communication blocks based on BSEND/BRCV (e.g. SEND_R from PCS 7 Library) are preferred in earlier versions:
- Maximum of 50 or 100 frames/second
- Maximum number of nodes: 30 (CPU412/414) or 62 (CPU 410-5H/416/417)
- The fastest possible cycle for the blocks on the transmitting and receiving end is 200 ms.
- The maximum transmission volume between two partner CPUs in an OB is 4,800 bytes.
- The volume to be transferred is calculated by adding all AS-wide interconnections of a CPU in bytes per second. The maximum possible volume that can be transferred varies depending on the CPU and its performance. This figure should not be exceeded.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

The automation program forms the basis of the automation. This program is configured in the CFC in PCS 7 and typically contains the program logic, including interlocks, as well as the connection to the process I/O. SIMATIC PCS 7 supports configuration with process tags according to the old model, but also the enhanced control module (CM) type model. The main advantage of CM technology over process tags lies in the flexible formation of variants and the optimal connection to a higher-level engineering, project execution and documentation tool such as PCS 7 Plant Automation Accelerator and the COMOS Plant Engineering Software.

# 8.2.1 Process tag types (templates)

A process tag type (template) is a project-specific interconnection of blocks. It serves as a model for a specific automation function.

# Example

A valve-control process tag type from the PCS 7 AP library is shown below. The valve-control process is completed here with the channel blocks for inputs and outputs, the technological blocks "Intlk02" and "VlvL". The "Bad" output of the driver blocks is interconnected to the "CSF" error input of the valve block (valve).

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

Numerous process tag types are available in the PCS 7 AP library. They serve as a basis and can be adapted to the automation function for a specific project in your master data library.

User-specific process tag types should be created in the same way as the process tag types of the PCS 7 AP library.

# Recommendation for creating custom process tag types

Note the following recommendations:

- Use the comment fields (for describing the logic, for example).
- Use channel blocks between the I/O data provided in the process image and the technological blocks.
- Arrange the blocks on the CFC sheets of the process tag type in a clear manner, e.g. consistently from top left to bottom right.
- Create variants of process tag types. If a valve needs two interlock blocks, for example, create a new process tag type for it.
- Test each process tag type before using it in the project.

Note

Information on creating CFCs and process tag types can be found in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

All process tag types are then to be saved in the master data library and can be maintained and edited there as needed.

The process tags (replicas) in the project result from the process tag types of the master data library - either by manual copying or using the Import/Export Assistant (see also section: Import/Export Assistant (IEA) (Page 193)).

# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

# 8.2.2 Control module type (CMT)

# Introduction

Compared with a process tag type, a control module type (CMT) has the following advantages:

- Instance-specific changes to the instance of the control module are not lost during synchronization of type and instance.
- It is possible to create different instances from one CMT. Optional blocks are configured for this in the CMT. When the instances are created, the optional blocks needed in the respective instance are defined. The "Technological I/Os" view is available for this in the CFC Editor.

CMTs also serve as an interface for the Plant Automatic Accelerator and the COMOS plant engineering software.

# Note

You can find information on the Plant Automation Accelerator in the "SIMATIC PCS 7 Plant Automation Accelerator using a practical example" application example. The "Control Module (CM) technology – Efficient engineering with SIMATIC PCS 7" application example describes how to work with the control module technology in the PCS 7 environment based on individual technological components and typical applications. These include:

- Structure of a CMT in comparison to process tag type (PTT)
- Structure of the interfaces
- Generation of a CMT with versions
- Configuration of a motor staging with CMT
- Function extensions and central type update

# Note

Additional information on managing control modules can be found in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" manual as well as in the CFC-Editor online help.

The settings for the number ranges should be the same for all S7 programs in the multiproject. It may be necessary to change the preset range depending on the additional project-specific user libraries.

The default settings are:

- DB: 1 to 60
- FC: 60 to 700

# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

Installed blocks for each sequence group or OB

The default limit of 50 blocks is sufficient for typical configuration cases. The monitoring is performed for:

- Blocks per sequence group (GROUP FC) or
- Blocks per TASK FC + sequence groups per TASK FC + SFCs per TASK FC

With the default setting of 50 blocks per sequence group or OB, a warning is triggered if more than 50 sequence groups (CFCs) are configured. Too many blocks per OB without using sequence groups can cause the SCL Compiler to abort, as the compiler can only create a maximum of one 64 KB FC per OB. The warning limit exists so that the 64 KB limit is not exceeded. You can set the warning limit individually (1 – 32767), for example, after empirical determination. To determine the warning limit empirically, the program must be compiled at regular intervals during the configuration. Then you can check in the block folder of the program whether a block (Task FC) is approaching the maximum allowable size of 64 KB. If the block size is close to this limit, the warning limit is set too high. If the block size is well below the limit of 64 KB, the warning limit can be increased.

If a block is close to the limit of 64 KB, you can reduce the block size by inserting new sequence groups or by moving blocks/sequence groups to a different cyclic interrupt. You can find additional information on this topic in the FAQ "Why does the error message 'Maximum length of code area reached (max. 64 KB)' or 'Insufficient main memory' appear when the CFC charts are compiled?" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/771569).

# Generate image of downloaded program for comparison

As of the PCS 7 V7.0, the "Generate image of downloaded program for comparison" option is available. This can prove useful or necessary as of a certain configuration phase (commissioning, production). If the option is activated, this allows you to subsequently view details of the changes to be downloaded; The "Show Changes" button is available for this purpose in the "Download" dialog window. The VXM tool (Version Cross Manager, including license) must be available.

Note
The VXM process image is not updated during selective downloading of charts. An update is complete if all changed charts have been downloaded.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

# 8.2.4 Run sequence

Principle of the run sequence

A runtime group is created for every CFC chart (process tag) automatically upon creation. The "Predecessor for runtime sequence" function in the runtime editor provides the option of determining the installation position of the next CFC chart within a cyclic interrupt OB. All blocks of a CFC chart are therefore assigned to the same cyclic interrupt OB. This ensures that the channel drivers and technological blocks are processed in the same cycle in a runtime sequence.

Note
If blocks with startup characteristics are included, these are also integrated in OB 100.

# 8.2 Configuration of the automation program (process tags / control modules)

# Execution time of the runtime groups

You can set the execution time of the process tags by inserting the corresponding runtime group in one of the following cyclic interrupt OBs.

|Cyclic interrupt OB|Default value for time frame|Default value for priority class|
|---|---|---|
|OB 30|5 s|7|
|OB 31|2 s|8|
|OB 32|1 s|9|
|OB 33|500 ms|10|
|OB 34|200 ms|11|
|OB 35|100 ms|12|
|OB 36|50 ms|13|
|OB 37|20 ms|14|
|OB 38|10 ms|15|

# Optimize the run sequence

The timing of each individual block, or of the entire program, can be optimized using the "Options > Optimize run sequence" system function. This optimization is recommended for PCS 7. If certain runtime groups (e.g. CFCs with cascade connections) are not to be optimized then the optimization may be deactivated in the runtime group properties.

One advantage of optimization is that all process tags of the entire S7 program are executed in the same order. This sequence is based on optimization under the IPO principle: Input driver block – Processed blocks - Output driver block.

Note

If the runtime group contains fail-safe blocks, the option is not activated. You can find more detailed information on the run sequence and how it is optimized in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# 8.3 Generation of logical operations

# General information on logical operations

Logical operations are used for interlocking functions, for example. These can be implemented within the PCS 7 program with the help of function blocks in the CFC. From PCS 7 V8.2, the SIMATIC Logic Matrix supports the generation of the required operations with an interface.

Generating logical operations with the Logic Matrix offers the following advantages:

- Clear generation of logical operations with the Logic Matrix Editor.
- Easy to amend and optimize the logical operations.
- Clear representation of the logical operations in the OS runtime.
- Filter options for quickly locating the cause of interlocking in the OS runtime.

Note

You will find detailed information on the SIMATIC Logic Matrix in the application example "Efficient engineering of interlocking with PCS 7 Logic Matrix" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109482621) and in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Logic Matrix" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748784) manual.

# 8.4 Creating step sequences

# General information about SFCs

The sequential function chart (SFC) is a sequential control system executed in stages which, depending on certain conditions, advances from one state to the next. A sequential control system controls functions, such as CFC charts, via mode and state changes, and processes them selectively.

It is created in the SFC editor. Block icons for SFCs and SFC types are generated automatically during OS compilation.

Note

Additional information on this is available in the "Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.4 Creating step sequences

# SFC types

In the SFC, there are the "SFC chart" and "SFC type" object types. The SFC type allows the definition of sequential controls and of an expandable interface. You can read about the advantages and disadvantages of SFC types/instances in the manual mentioned above.

Note The creation of SFC types is described in detail in "Compendium Part C - Technical Functions with SFC Types".

An SFC type is generally preferred if a step sequencer (SFC) is used several times in the project. The instances are placed in the CFC chart similar to a function block. The SFC type is contained in the associated chart folder.

As of PCS 7 V7.0, the SFC type can be centrally edited in the master data library and all instances in the project can be automatically updated. In addition, ways of accessing the SFC instances are listed in the chart reference data of the CFC.

# Method of operation

The Plant Automation Accelerator includes an interface for bidirectional exchange of engineering data with SIMATIC PCS 7. This enables the PAA to also work alternatingly in both programs. For transferring data, the PAA supports a delta view for synchronizing between PAA and PCS 7. The user decides on the requirements and performs supervised bulk data engineering.

The PAA offers the following options for transferring and synchronizing:

- Direct data exchange: If PAA and PCS 7 are installed on the same computer, data is exchanged over an integrated interface in PAA.
- Indirect data exchange: If PAA and PCS 7 are installed on different computers, data is exchanged using XML files.

# 8.5.2 Import/Export Assistant (IEA)

Introduction

During the planning of a plant, a wide variety of data is created, often at a time where no definite control system is planned. By using the import function, this data can be made available to the control system engineering. You use the import/export assistant if you want to frequently use multiple models or process tag types in a project (bulk data processing) and change block parameter descriptions easily.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.5 Bulk data and integrated engineering

# Scope of functions

The functions that can be used with the IEA include:

- Standardized plant libraries with tested process tag types and models
- Import of plant data (e.g. process tag lists or I/O lists) from the higher-level CAD/CAE environment
- Automatic generation of the AS configuration based on imported process tag lists and process tag types (CMTs cannot be used).
- Creation of the plant hierarchy
- Editing stored process tags
- Automatic derivation of the OS picture hierarchy, automatic connection of blocks, and positioning within pictures
- Automatic creation of an OS archive
- Creation of individual process objects using appropriate graphical tools such as CFC and SFC
- Export of optimized parameters back to the CAD/CAE environment

# Working with the import / export assistant (IEA)

The Import Export Assistant offers the convenient option of creating function charts using process tag types and models. You also are given the option of exporting the files created in PCS 7 (for plant documentation, for example), editing them in Excel, and then importing them back into PCS 7.

The following procedure should be followed when creating process tag types and models:

- Create the process tag types and test them to ensure that they function correctly. Changes made at a later cost time.
- All workers in a multiproject should use the same process tag types. Each worker should be assigned a name band for IEA files he creates. This allows the files to be easily entered into the multiproject. The workers should be able to use the process tag type for import, but should not be allowed to change the template. Changes should always be made from a central location, and then made available to the workers.
- The IEA should be only be used during the configuration phase. Changes to parameters and interconnections in the charts should be made during the FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) or during commissioning. Since users make changes in the charts and not in the IEA files, any new IEA import may overwrite the changes.
- During the FAT and subsequently while the plant is in process mode, the process object view offers the possibility of editing charts created via the IEA in tabular form. You also have the option here of exporting and importing (see also section:"Managing process tag types with the process object view (Page 195)").

# 8.6 Managing process tag types with the process object view

# Introduction

In the process object view, all the data of the basic control can be displayed in a process control oriented view throughout the project. This means that a multiproject encompasses the data of all the projects within it.

The process object view is mainly used during the FAT and commissioning. These tasks involve working efficiently with great amount of data at a centralized location. The process object view has the advantage that all changeable tags/values of an object (white background) can be centrally edited.

When editing process tags and CFCs, all aspects (automation, I/O connection, messages, operation, and monitoring) can be consistently displayed and documented. Jumps to CFCs, SFCs, HW Config, and to the OS enable you to edit tags/values which cannot be edited in the table (e.g. parameter definition of the models, picture contents).

Note

Information on the structure and on working with the process object view can be found in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.6 Managing process tag types with the process object view

# Filter function of the process object view

Filtering in the process object view is a comprehensive tool. A filter with a variety of criteria is shown here as an example:

- Process tag type "FI" (flow measurements)
- Blocks of type "MonAnL"
- "PV_OPScale.High" connections (measuring range high limit for the faceplate bar graph)

Values can be easily selected, checked, and modified using the different filter functions "General", "Block", and "I/O".

In PCS 7 version V8.1, the process object view has been supplemented with the "Charts" tab. All charts contained in the multiproject, including charts without PH assignment, are shown in this tab. This enables charts to be found quickly and simply. Switching from one project to another is not necessary, since all charts are displayed in one tab.

# Configuring AS functions

# 8.6 Managing process tag types with the process object view

The relevant chart can be selected using a filter and opened directly from the process object view. Furthermore, the assignment of charts to an AS is visible immediately.

# Exporting and importing inputs/outputs and messages

Through the exporting and importing of attributes you have the option of exporting information on parameters, signals and messages to a file, processing it with standard applications and inputting it (importing it) again.

Note

Filters are ignored during import/export. All data are always exported when they are displayed in the current view without filter.

These functions are particularly beneficial if you want to edit large amounts of data. You do not need to open the individual charts with the CFC editor in order to edit the I/Os, as the I/Os of all charts in the hierarchy folders are imported automatically.

- Display data for fail-safe applications
- Split view with display in two windows (see above)
- View from WinCC Tag Logging for tabular configurtion of archive tags
- Defining user columns
- Undo

Always work in the process object view where possible. The overview provides considerable advantage in comparison to working in a CFC. The process object view also offers all the options of the plant hierarchy.

# 8.7 Technological list editor

# 8.8 Comparing projects with the Version Cross Manager (VXM)

# Functions

- Table-based engineering using CMTs
- Parameter assignment and interconnection of parameters of CMs
- Parameter assignment and interconnection of signals of CMs
- Parameter assignment of messages and alarms of CMs
- Export and import to/from Microsoft Excel
- Selective export to Excel using copy and paste
- Import to the list editor using copy and paste
- Identification of data inconsistencies during import

# Advantages

- Reduction of engineering errors
- MS Excel engineering requires no system-specific knowledge
- Export of CM-based engineering data without special tools – based on standard functions

# 8.8 Comparing projects with the Version Cross Manager (VXM)

The Version Cross Manager detects differences between the various revision levels (versions) of an engineering project. It can compare entire projects, hardware configurations, CFC/SFC charts, block types and instances, signals, run sequences, etc., with one another and thus detect any objects which are missing, which have been added, or which are different.

The import and export of project and planning data plus generation of process tags from CAx function charts are available as additional functions.

Note

The VXM process image is not updated during selective downloading of charts. An update is complete if all changed charts have been downloaded.

Usage scenarios and information on working with the Version Cross Manager can be found in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# 8.9 Archiving/Versioning with Version Trail

The overall multiproject should be archived on a regular basis, with all projects and the master data library. If a number of changes are made during commissioning and FAT in the engineering stages, an archive/backup should be created every day. Archiving the relevant projects following each AS change download is recommended in production.

In addition to the easy archiving/retrieval via SIMATIC Manager there is also the option of versioning, creating and managing archives with the optional "Version Trail" package, although the archived data cannot be changed once this has been done. This means that defined archive versions can be compared with one another using the Version Cross Manager. You also have the option of setting up archiving in a time-controlled manner.

From PCS 7 V8.1 onwards, you have the option of automatic archiving after the successful downloading of the user program.

Note

A description of the process for archiving, including with the optional "Version Trail" package can be found in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) manual.

# Compiling and downloading

# 9.1 Compiling the user program

The charts are reproduced in functions (FC) and data blocks (DB) when compiling the user program. The program is also checked for consistency, errors and warnings.

A one-off compilation of the overall program is required at the start. Following this a compilation of the changes will suffice.

When compiling in PCS 7 it is important that the "Generate module drivers" option is always selected where HW Config of the AS has been changed beforehand.

Note

As of PCS 7 V7.0, the two options "Make textual interconnections" and "Delete Empty Runtime Groups" are no longer available in the compilation dialog; they appear in the CFC editor instead. The sampling times are updated during every compilation.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

Loading the hardware and the network configuration into the AS are conditions for downloading the user program. You can find information about this in the following sections:

- Creating and managing a PCS 7 project (Page 51)
- Configuration of the hardware (AS and I/O) (Page 89)
- Configuration of the network connections (Page 149)

Note

Do not load any blocks directly from the block folder of the SIMATIC Manager with PCS 7; download the charts solely via the selected chart folder in the SIMATIC Manager or via the function in the CFC/SFC Editor.

You can also download changes directly to the chart folder without starting compilation beforehand. The system recognizes the changes in the program and completes a compilation first of all.

A full download is required when the user program is downloaded for the first time. For this the CPU switches from RUN to STOP mode following corresponding notification. Interface changes to a function or a function block also require a full download of the program.

Note

With PCS 7 V8.1 or higher and CPU 410-5H (firmware V8.1) an interface change of a function or a block does not necessarily mean you lose the ability to download changes (see section "Updating block types (Page 174)"). Downloading the changes is then normally sufficient for any program expansions.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

What situations will prevent online downloads of changes?

It is no longer possible to download changes if the following conditions are present:

- A used block type has been replaced by a new version that contains structural changes, for example, due to the addition of I/Os and/or messages. An exception to this is the CPU 410-5H process automation with a firmware version from V8.1 which supports the function "Type Change in Run" (TCiR). For more information, refer to the section "Updating block types (Page 174)".
- DB and FC number areas have been compressed during compilation using the menu command Options > Settings > Compile/Download… > Option: "Compress". DBs and FCs will be assigned a new numbering sequence in this case.
- When a modified program was downloaded to a different CPU prior to the download of changes, for example, for debugging purposes. In this case, the time stamp no longer matches the time stamp of the original CPU. An exception to this is provided where the "Download to Test CPU" option is used in the "Download S7" dialog box. In this case the download ID and the comparison time stamp are retained. You can still therefore transfer the program to the original CPU by downloading changes.
- If you resort to an archived program that is not the original from the most recent download (time stamp comparison).

Note

Refer to the online help for the CFC Editor and to the "Downloading changes online (Page 305)" section for additional information.

Compendium Part A - Configuration Guidelines (V9.0)

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

If the parameters for a controller are changed in OS runtime, for example, they are written directly to the AS. If a complete download is made from the ES, the parameters changed on the OS will be overwritten by the ES. A prompt appears therefore before a complete download asking if you want to read back the parameters from the AS to the ES.

It is recommended that only parameters changed by the OS (or other communication partners if applicable) should be read back. This can be selected via the "Operational and observable parameters" option. If the "All parameters" option is activated, the entire current program state of the AS is read back, including the status of the logic. This may lead to undesired program states and, as a result, plant states during subsequent complete downloads.

If read back of the parameters is confirmed with "OK", then the updated S7 program is downloaded in full to the AS following the read back.

Work can continue with compiling and downloading changes as soon as the AS is in RUN mode again.

# 9.2 Downloading the user program

Comparing Time Stamps

To check whether the AS has downloaded with the current configuration status you can run the "Compare time stamp" function in the CFC Editor via "PLC > Compare". The program currently configured has been downloaded if the time stamp of the last compilation is the same as the time stamp of the program downloaded and the time stamp of the last download-related change is dated before the two other time stamps. An easier check can be made directly via the symbol for the chart folder of the component view. If a small arrow is shown there in the symbol then the current configuration has not been downloaded.

Auto-archiving after successful download

Starting with PCS 7 version V8.1, the "Auto-archiving" function is available to you in the "Download to target system" dialog box. Archiving is performed automatically after downloading by activating the "Archive project after successful download" option. The option can only be activated if a versioned project was selected via the "Browse versioned project" button. Archiving is performed automatically using a version trail by activating the "Archive project after successful download" option. Archiving starts only after a successful download. Version Trail is opened for this purpose.

Note

The "Archive project after successful download" option requires that the Version trail options package is installed on the ES.

# 9.3 Selective download

The "Selective Download" function can be used to download one or more modified CFCs or SFCs to a CPU. You can use selective downloading to specifically select which configured changes should be transferred to the target system and enabled. A parallel configuration of multiple subsystems onto one target system is possible in this regard, for example. In such a case, the changes can be compiled, downloaded, and tested for the individual subsystems.

# Selecting the charts

A dialog box displays all charts that can be selectively downloaded. Select the charts that you want to download in this dialog. Dependent charts are automatically selected from the system.

The charts that are not selected but affected by the changes are not transferred. System charts with the prefix "@" are not displayed. These are transferred automatically if they are affected by the changes.

# Note

Dependent charts arise due to one of the following conditions:

- Change to an SFC type > all charts that contain an instance of this SFC type are dependent and are also downloaded when the SFC type is downloaded.
- A dependent chart is a chart that contains at least one block which is in the same runtime group as a block of the chart to be downloaded.

# CAUTION

Make sure that no dangerous system states can arise before downloading. If you have changed multiple charts with cross-chart interconnections and not all charts later transfer to the AS together through the "Selective Download" function, then damage could occur due to inconsistent states.

# Note

You can find further information on the subject of the “Selective Download” function in the configuration manual "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533) and in the function manual "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 CFC for SIMATIC S7" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109748700).

# 9.3 Selective download

Chart-based insertion of blocks in runtime groups in OB 100

To use the "Selective Download" function, it is recommended to enable the "Chart-based insertion" option in the "Properties Chart Folder" dialog.

With the "chart-based insertion" option activated, an appropriate runtime group is automatically created in the OB 100 when instantiating blocks with startup characteristics. All block instances in a chart that have a startup characteristic are integrated in the cyclical runtime groups and in the runtime group assigned to this plan in the OB 100.

- With PCS 7 projects created from version V8.1 onwards, the "chart-based insertion" option is activated automatically in the properties of the chart folder.
- The "chart-based insertion" option must be activated manually for upgraded projects created with a version before V8.1. After the activation, the option only affects newly created charts. The existing charts and their configuration are not affected by this activation.

To activate this function select the relevant chart folder and select the context menu "Object Properties > Expanded".

Inserting the new blocks of a chart in the runtime group of this chart reduces the number of dependent charts, which would also need to be included in the selective download.

# 9.3 Selective download

"Migration to chart-based insertion" function

From PCS 7 V8.2, the function "Migration to chart-based insertion" is available. This function allows you to automatically change existing CFC charts, whose blocks are not contained in chart-based runtime groups in the OB 100, to chart-based administration. I.e., the blocks of a CFC chart are automatically inserted in new, chart-related runtime groups. The chart-related runtime groups receive the same names as the corresponding CFC charts and a serial number, if required.

You can find further information in FAQ "How do you use the "Selective Download" function in migrated PCS 7 projects?" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109478772).

Color representation of a block or chart I/O

If a block or chart I/O has been changed, for example, due to configuration or interconnection, this status is indicated by a colored representation of this I/O. The color representation can be changed through the system function "Extras -> Settings -> Colors".

# Compiling and downloading

# 9.4 Compile OS

# Introduction

With the OS compilation all the relevant AS engineering data is transferred to the OS project and any corresponding OSD objects are created automatically (e.g. picture hierarchy, SFC display, process tag symbols and picture blocks, tags, messages, archive tags, OS server package). The actual OS configuration is thereby reduced to creating the static picture objects and positioning the process tag symbols created.

# OS compilation mode

The OS compilation mode can compile multiple OS within a project with an OS single/OS server station via the "Options > Compile multiple OS assistant" menu in the SIMATIC Manager ("20_OS" in the example).

With the "Area-oriented" mode the OS allocation of the area determined in the plant hierarchy (PH) is decisive rather than the S7 program allocated when creating the OS objects during the OS compilation. You can only select this mode when there is a configured PH. This mode is the default for new projects as of V6.1.

Note

We recommend using the "Area-oriented" compilation mode. This setting must be used for the PCS 7 Web option and PCS 7 asset management functions.

A change between area-based and AS-based requires that one AS is only assigned to one OS. Otherwise, messages are displayed more than once. To save time during compilation, areas to which no amendments were made can be selected. Therefore, only the amended AS is compiled.

Following each change, a complete compilation with memory reset is forced.

- The symbolic name remains unchanged, even if the IP addresses are changed again.
- Symbolic connections are created as reserved connections in the AS.

You can find additional information on symbolic connections (named connection) in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

Create/Update Block Icons

As of PCS 7 V7.0, the "Create/Update Block Icons" function is no longer listed as an option for OS compilation. If the "Derive block icons from the plant hierarchy" check box is set in the properties of a picture, the function is called automatically when the OS is compiled.

In addition to automatic execution of the "Create/Update Block Icons" function it can also be initiated separately via the plant hierarchy. For this open the "Create/Update Block Icons" dialog box via the "Plant hierarchy" context menu in the plant hierarchy. This dialog box has an option for adapting the structure of the process tag name (TAG) and for determining the number of lower levels that are taken into account in creating or updating the block icons.

The following image shows the "Create/Update Block Icons" dialog box.

The PCS 7 picture blocks are implemented as a change function when the OS is compiled or with the "Create/Update Block Icons" function. The associated picture is updated when a change is made in the CFC chart. All block icons of a picture are updated for all other changes.

E.g. if one of the "@PCS7Typicals*.pdl" or "@PCS7TypicalsXYZ.pdl" template pictures changes, all plant pictures are updated.

Note

With the "Zoom block icons" option, you can proportionally scale the block icons and thus adjust them to the right size for the screen resolution. If the "Automatically place block icons" option is activated, all automatically generated block icons in the WinCC images are placed once more (from top left to bottom right).

# 10.1.1 Defining the server assignment

# Introduction

In order for a client to be able to display the process data from different servers in a distributed system, it needs information about the associated data. Server data (packages) are generated for this, to be provided to the clients. The client requires the server data from all servers, whose process information it should visualize.

The system creates/updates the server data automatically during OS compilation and download. Alternatively, the server data can be generated manually in the SIMATIC Manager using "Generate server data" in the context menu.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.2 Selecting a preferred server

Introduction

In order to achieve even utilization of a redundant server pair and constant operability, even during a switchover to the redundancy partner, you should assign one section of the OS clients to the master server and another to the standby server.

A "preferred server" is an OS server in the redundant OS server pair that the OS client connects to preferentially. The OS client receives the data from there as long as this OS server is available.

This requires a consistent connection configuration on both OS servers and no errors (redundancy) at the PCS 7 end. If the connection configuration is inconsistent or if there are errors in the redundancy connections, the OS client switches to the OS server with the most active/error-free connections.

Note

If no preferred server is entered in the "Configure the Server Data" dialog, the OS clients interconnect to the OS server that is designated as the master.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# 10.1.3 Selecting and configuring a standard server

Introduction

You configure a standard server for a client in a distributed system to:

- Receive messages and alarms
- Make the user-configured message classes available on a client
- Create operator messages on the client
- Make trend groups assembled on a client available to other clients
- Have access to user archives

A standard server setting is required on each client.

Note

Selected standard servers (e.g. for operator messages, alarms, user-configured message classes, etc.) set on a client should be configured redundantly.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# Procedure

In the “Configure Standard Servers" dialog, the standard servers are specified for the components individually listed in the dialog.

Select the standard server for the "Alarms" and "SSM" (Split Screen Manager) components only.

# Note

# Alarms

A standard server must always be specified for alarms. No alarm logging can be configured on the client itself. Operator messages, which are generated on a client following a successful operation, are saved on the standard server.

The user-configured message classes are transferred from the standard server.

# Tags

No standard server may be specified for tags.

# SSM (Split Screen Manager)

A standard server must always be specified for the SSM component. If trend groups are assembled on a client, they are saved on the standard server and synchronized with the redundant partner server on a cyclical basis.

# User archives

Select the user archives component only if you have configured a user archive.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

When an OS project is created in the ES, the OS project editor is opened in the background and initialized with default settings.

If you need another configuration, start the OS project editor from the WinCC Explorer and configure the required project settings.

# Example OS client layout

The settings can also be modified at a later time, if necessary.

Note

Not all configuration options are available in the OS project editor in the "Configurations that support online delta loading only" mode. In this mode, the only settings that can be changed are those that do not require a complete download of the PCS 7 OS. To be able to make other changes, you need to switch to "Complete configuration (loss of support for online delta loading)" in the OS project editor in the "General" tab.

You will find more information on this topic in the WinCC Online Help.

# 10.1.5 Language settings

Language settings in WinCC

There are several menus in WinCC, which you can use to set the language. The following explains the importance of the language setting.

# Menu commands in the WinCC Explorer

- "Options > Languages" menu: This is where you set the language for the user interfaces.
- "Computer > Properties > Parameters" menu: This is where you set the language for runtime. You can also set the language for printing out the project documentation in WinCC in this field.

# Menu command in the Graphics Designer

- "View > Language" menu: You first have to select the language for displaying pictures in runtime before configuring the pictures.

# Menu command in alarm logging

- "View > Language" menu:
- Display of message texts in the selected language
- The message texts need to be compiled in the text library

# Language settings for Runtime

- Button for language selection: You can set the current display language for runtime here. To do this, you need to configure all switchable parts to the respective language.

Note

WinCC is always opened from the Simatic Manager in the language which is set there. Only if WinCC is not opened from the Simatic Manager will the language correspond to the one set before the program was last exited.

# Additional information

Further instructions and information on language settings can be found in the document "Configuring texts and languages in SIMATIC PCS 7".

# 10.1.7 Time synchronization

Introduction

The following example shows in abbreviated form the activation of time synchronization on the OS computers in a Windows domain with a central plant clock.

As of Windows 2000 Server, all domain controllers (DC) have the same authorizations. Time synchronization must be executed by the DC which performs the role of the "PDC emulator" operating master.

The time signal comes from a SICLOCK central plant clock, which can be synchronized both via GPS and DCF77.

Note

You can find the configuration options available with PCS 7 (e.g. Windows workgroup/Windows domain with/without a central plant clock) and the corresponding detailed configuration instructions in the manual "PCS 7 Time synchronization" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746544).

You can find information on further configuration options here: https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/61931975

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

# Principle

To ensure and check the completeness and correctness of the time synchronization settings for the system components, a separate record or documentation of these settings is recommended:

- Excel template
Using an Excel table, you can record and continually document how the time synchronization is configured for each individual component. This allows you to have an overview of all components and their relations in terms of time synchronization. You will find an example template attached to this contribution in the Industry Online Support, which you can adapt and fill out for your system configurations.
- Drawing
In addition or as an alternative to the Excel template, the settings for time synchronization can be recorded graphically. Based on a drawing of the system components used as well as their networking, arrows can be introduced, which represent the adjusted time synchronization.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

Settings in the "Time Synchronization" editor in the OS server project

Time synchronization of the plant bus is performed via the OS server and the redundant OS partner server with the aid of the CP1613/CP1623/CP1628.

Note

If the ES does not have a CP1613/CP1623/CP1628, select the "Display symbolic name of the access points" option in the "Synchronization via System Bus (Master, Slave)" area.

Select the communication processor (CP1613/CP1623/1628) from the "Access point 1" drop-down list and select the "Master" check box.

The OS servers act as cooperative time masters, in other words, the first OS server active on the plant bus to not receive a time frame on the plant bus switches automatically to time "master" mode. All other OS servers on the plant bus detect the time message frame from the time master and automatically switch to time "slave" mode. A cooperative master does not have to belong to a redundant server.

Select the following parameters in the OS server project:

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.1 Project settings

"Display symbolic name of the access point" option: To configure the time synchronization from an ES, you can also display symbolic names of the access points that are represented by "&lt;&gt;". Activate the corresponding check box. When the target computer boots up in runtime, these names are assigned to the access points. If e.g. you use two access points with CP1623, the following modules are assigned to the symbolic names using SIMATIC NET:

|Symbolic name|Dialog field "Set PG/PC interface"|Dialog field "Set PC station"|
|---|---|---|
|&lt;CP1623 (1)&gt;|CP1623(ISO)|CP1623|
|&lt;CP1623 (2)&gt;|CP1623(ISO)&lt;Board2|CP1623(2)|

The two internal tags "@TimeSyncDevice1State" and "@TimeSynDevice2State" are used for the two access points. The tags are used in Runtime for diagnostics and displaying the status of the access points. The settings are "Slave", "Standby master", "Active master" and "Deactivated".

"Process controlling messages" option: Process control messages are displayed in Runtime if synchronization problems occur. For the process control messages 1012002-1012005, 1012018 and 1012021 you can set how often the process control messages are to be displayed in Runtime in the "Process control messages" field. Activate the "Send once" check box to have the process control messages shown only once. If you want to send the process control message several times in Runtime, deactivate the "Send once" check box. Enter the desired value in the "Send every ... minutes" input field or use the dial control.

# 10.1.8 Graphics Runtime on the OS clients

Block the key combinations in the computer properties of the OC client projects. This prevents access to the operating system during runtime.

To ensure the Windows taskbar remains hidden during process mode even when standalone applications are called (e.g. "Picture selection by name", "Picture selection by process tag", "User permission", or "SFC visualization"), the "Keep the taskbar on top of other windows" check box must be deactivated in the Windows operating system under "Taskbar and Start Menu Properties".

# 10.1.9 Graphics Runtime on the OS servers

The following alternative measures are recommended for the purpose of reducing the load for OS servers which are not used as operating stations at the same time:

- Selecting the "SIMATIC Server" server layout in the OS project editor in the "Layout" tab. Generally applies to all OS servers, in particular OS servers with more than 4 OS clients. Granting of rights in accordance with the User Administrator and locking to prevent unauthorized key combinations is possible with this.
- Deactivation of the graphics runtime and the associated applications, e.g. SFCRT (visualization of SFC blocks) in the startup list in "Computer properties". Additional applications that have been added through the individual WinCC editors of the startup list cannot be removed.

# 10.1.10 OS resource utilization

The limiting values recommended in this section for OS servers or OS single stations are based on empirical values. They are listed as OS quantity structures in the event of Alarm Logging and Tag Logging in the PCS 7 catalog.

# Work station

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if enough hard disk space is available for operation of the Microsoft SQL Server.

System partition (C): The available hard disk space must be greater than 20%.

# Task Manager

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the following values are adhered to within the Task Manager:

- System performance: Processor utilization less than 30% on average
- System performance: Available physical memory greater than 200 MB

# Alarm Logging

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the constant load of messages for an OS server is less than 10 messages per second. The check can be made by additional configuration of an Alarm Control as a hitlist in a process picture.

# Tag Logging

After completion of the OS engineering, check while OS Runtime is running to see if the tag logging for an OS server is less than 1500 values per second. For this monitor the internal tags @TLGRT_TAGS_PER_SECOND and @TLGRT_AVERAGE_TAGS_PER_SECOND in the TagLoggingRT group.

# Note

Check the configuration as well as the associated infrastructure if these limiting values are being reached or even exceeded.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.2 Visualization interface

# AS-OS communication

The wait times when opening pictures/faceplates depend on, among other things, the load of the AS from which the data for the corresponding picture/faceplate is obtained. A faceplate can therefore have different display times in two different automation systems when the associated block is activated.

You can find further information on diagnosing the reasons and on taking corrective actions in the "How do you shorten any delays in the display of screens/faceplates in the PCS 7 OS?" FAQ.

# Increased availability as part of Lifecycle agreements

When limits are exceeded, appropriate measures must be taken to reduce the load of the OS server and to guarantee the performance of OS Runtime.

# 10.2.2 Design of process pictures

# Introduction

In general, process pictures are created in accordance with a set of specifications which are drawn up in close collaboration with the customer. Sector- and company-specific standards and guidelines must be taken into account.

A layer can be defined for each picture object, line, etc. in Graphic Designer. The distribution of the different components among the individual layers enables the components to be quickly arranged and adjusted, e.g. line on layer 4 and faceplates on layer 5.

In the sample project, the following definitions have been laid down:

# Function design

This function is provided for user objects. Use faceplates from the OS library.

# Cable design

|Color|Black:|Product|
|---|---|---|
| |Yellow:|Gas, N2|
| |Dark red:|Steam, heating system|
| |Green:|Water|
| |Blue:|Air|
|Width|Wide:|Main product cables (line width 4)|
| |Narrow:|Other cables (line width 2)|

# Boiler design

Represent boilers in graphics by means of black lines on a gray background. The boiler shape is defined by the RI flowchart.

Use static text to indicate the volume of the boilers. The fill quantity is shown by means of a bar on the boiler.

Situation- and task-oriented process views

In addition to the process pictures predominantly oriented to the instrumentation at the "subsystem" level, which are created based on pipeline and instrument flow charts, you can also create information-based overview and group displays. These are specially oriented to the process control task. You can also structure the views hierarchically.

The figure below shows the hierarchy level:

# 10.2 Visualization interface

This is implemented using the system library APL (Advanced Process Library) and the AddOn APG (Advanced Process Graphics). In this process, the AddOn APG supplies a function block, which collects the data from the AS and supplies the graphic objects provided by APG with data. It is thus possible to create overview images that represent the entire state of the process. This way the user can see whether there is a deviation from normal operation (work area) in good time. He can therefore intervene before warning or alarm messages are output.

Note

Take note of the following recommendations when creating process pictures:

- The use of numerous or extensive C actions and/or VBS actions increases the system load which can have a negative influence on picture-call times in runtime. Move cyclic computing operations to the automation system and avoid executing them on the OS.
- To achieve picture opening times of less than 2 seconds do not configure more than 100 process objects in one process picture.

# 10.2.3 Block icons/User objects

Block icons are graphic objects of the "user object" (UDO, User-Defined Object) type, which represent a corresponding block type in the OS. Block icon templates for all block types/process tag types used in PCS 7 can be found in the *@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl* typical picture.

The graphic objects from this typical picture are used during OS compilation and inserted into the process pictures and linked to the appropriate process tag automatically in accordance with the plant hierarchy.

# 10.2.4 Custom block icons / user objects

The "Create/Update Block Icons" function uses the following template pictures:

- Template pictures created by the project engineer
- Name starts with "@PCS7Typicals"
- Number restricted to 10
- Default template pictures from the picture "@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl"
The picture "@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl" is contained in every PCS 7 OS project as standard. It contains the current block icons for PCS 7 V9.0.

Note

The original "@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl" file must not be changed! Changes to the original file are overwritten in the event of an update or upgrade.

User-defined template pictures must be created for customer-specific block icons. These must start in all cases with the fixed name component "@PCS7Typicals". The file name following this can be determined freely.

The "Create/Update Block Icons" function open all pictures with the fixed name component "@PCS7Typicals" and ascertains the picture priority alphabetically using the names:

- Prio 1: "@PCS7Typicals_MyAPL.pdl" (starting with the last picture alphabetically)
- Prio 2: "@PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl"
- Prio 3: "@PCS7TypicalsAPLV7.pdl"

The pictures with the highest priority are added.

The "Create/Update Diagnostic Screens" function uses the template pictures from "@@MaintenanceTypicals".

Note

If a personal template is used in the project, in which the block symbol is based on the APL, these can also be migrated when updating. When migrating, the amended properties, such as the position of the status indicator, are kept and new functions or components from the template @PCS7TypicalsAPLV8.pdl are carried over.

# 10.2 Visualization interface

When the OS project is compiled, the block icons are derived/updated from the plant hierarchy.

Note

The derivation of the block icons is controlled with configuration files. A user normally does not have to adapt the configuration files supplied by the system.

The following attributes of the block icons are taken into consideration in the configuration file without adaptation:

- Higher ProcessControlling
- ProcessControlling
- View Tag
- Return Path
- StandardTrend
- Format_InputValue
- Format_OutputValue
- Format_xx
- defaultPos
- leftPos
- topPos

If other attribute values are to be taken into account when updating the block icons, the configuration must be adapted accordingly.

You can find a detailed description of this under "Structure of the Configuration File" in the WinCC Information System.

# 10.2.7 Wizards

If block icons are not derived from the plant hierarchy (PH) in the SIMATIC Manager by default, various wizards are available for working with user object templates.

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.1 Message classes and message types

Introduction

Interrupts and messages are divided into message classes and message types. There are default settings for message classes and message types provided by the system when a project is created. These predefined message classes and message types can be selected in the AS configuration.

Note

The "User-configurable message classes” function allows the representation and sorting to be configured, such as sorting according to predefined importance. When using the "User-configurable message classes" function, observe the information in the section "Configuring the PCS 7 message system" in the manual "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Engineering System" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746533).

The message configuration is described in detail with step-by-step instructions in the "Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station" configuration manual. The section below provides a brief summary of the individual features provided by PCS 7 for configuring a convenient message system:

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

Note

For display of "Emergency messages" the highest priority 16 (Emergency) is used in a separate "Highest priority alarms" list. A button which can be selected in order to display these messages has been added to the plant overview, next to the message line. This button flashes for as long as messages with this priority are still pending, irrespective of whether they have been acknowledged or not.

Note

To prevent too many messages being generated, the SIMATIC PCS 7 message concept employs cumulative message suppression.

Example: An I/O module with eight channels can signal a wire break for every channel. If the I/O module is not connected to a power supply, just this one message is output and other messages relating to wire breaks are suppressed.

# Alarm, warning, and tolerance messages

Alarm, warning and tolerance messages indicate that a limit value has been exceeded. These limit values have been defined in the user-configured CFC. The Interrupt message class is usually used for emergency stop and other high-priority binary messages too. The messages/signals are aimed at the operator.

# AS process control messages

AS process control messages provide information about errors in I/O peripherals and in the system, e.g. wire break, short circuit, channel error, module failure, access error, redundancy failure, or failure of the auxiliary current. If a system-generated message or signal is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# 10.3 Message system

# OS process control messages

OS process control messages provide information about errors in the OS system, e.g. errors relating to database access, failure of OS server redundancy, errors relating to time synchronization. If a system-generated message or a signal for field instruments is displayed, the operator must inform the service team without delay.

# Preventive maintenance

Preventive maintenance indicates that maintenance personnel will soon have to take a look at devices/components (due to a dirty sensor, for example).

# Process messages

Process messages are specified to a user.

# Operational messages

Operational messages provide information about the plant status during conventional operation (e.g. "Temperature setpoint reached").

# Operator prompts

Operator prompts are messages generated by the sequential control or stacking systems which prompt the operator to perform certain tasks.

# Operator messages

Operator messages indicate which tasks the operator has performed manually (e.g. "User xy: control T4711: W was: 20 DEGC, W is now: 35 DEGC"). These can also be system-generated messages which refer to events occurring in the system (e.g. "Incorrect password").

# Status messages

Status messages provide information about system states during normal operation and also document these states (e.g. "Logon via Smart card").

Adapting the default settings

The information below only concerns users who are forced to modify the system default settings regarding colors and the acknowledgment theory in accordance with their requirements or who have to configure their own messages in the alarm logging system, since the S7 channel (Protocol Suite) is not used (e.g. TELEPERM M connection).

Assign a message class to each message during the configuration of the message system. When doing this, you do not have to make the numerous settings for each message; you can make the settings for the entire message class.

Up to 13 message classes can be defined in PCS 7. An acknowledgment mode is also specified for each message class. In turn, message types can be defined within the individual message classes. The text and background colors of a message are specified by its message class and message type.

Up to 16 message types can be defined within one message class. Messages are broadly divided into system-generated messages and messages containing information on the plant status. The table below provides an overview of the recommended message classes and message types. The solution here has been adapted to meet the requirements of the chemical industry.

|Message class|Message type|Acknowledgment|Target group|Color|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Interrupt (1)|Top interrupt (1)|Signal for new value with single acknowledgment|Operators|White/red|
| |Bottom interrupt (2)| | | |
|Warning (2)|Top warning (19)|Signal for new value with single acknowledgment|Operators|Black/yellow|

# Introduction

SIMATIC PCS 7 categorizes and displays messages in different message lists, based on their status and type. The message lists below are implemented in the message line:

|Message line|Displays the latest unacknowledged message above the process overview|
|---|---|
|Incoming alarm list|Displays all unacknowledged messages|
|Acknowledged alarm list|Displays all acknowledged process messages which are still active|
|Outgoing alarm list|Displays all messages marked as "Outgoing", which have not been acknowledged.|
|List of pending messages|Displays acknowledged and unacknowledged messages that have not yet gone out.|
|Process alarm list|Displays all process control messages|
|Operation list|Displays all operator messages (e.g. "A controller setpoint is set to xxx.")|
|Journal list|Displays all messages (incoming, acknowledged, and outgoing messages)|
|Hidden alarm list|Displays all active, manually hidden, and automatically hidden messages.|
|List of messages to be hidden|Display of all event messages which are hidden when they occur.|
|Lock list|Displays all messages that are locked|

Note: The list of hidden messages and the list of messages to hide are available as of PCS 7 V7.0.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.3 Acknowledgment concept

A distinction is made between the status of the message source (process value 0/1) and the acknowledgment status (not acknowledged/acknowledged) for a message. The two are combined to give the message status.

# Message status

A message recognizes up to four statuses, depending on the acknowledgment concept:

- Came in
- Came in, acknowledged
- Came in, went out, unacknowledged
- Came in, went out, acknowledged

The current message status is indicated by the following attributes:

- Color and flashing display of the elements
- Plain text in text elements
- Time entries in the message line

You can configure the acknowledgment theory of a message of the message type in the alarm logging of the WinCC Configuration Studio in the properties window "Properties – Message Type".

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.3 Message system

Note

From PCS 7 V8.1, the message types adopt the properties of the message classes. The message classes remain as a higher-level element of the message types and can still be used with their group variables. These properties can thus be used more flexibly in the message types.

# Acknowledgment theory options

You can select from eight different states for the acknowledgment of a message:

- Single message without acknowledgment
- Single message with came in acknowledgment
- Single message with dual-mode acknowledgment
- First value message with single-mode acknowledgment
- New value message with single-mode acknowledgment
- New value message with dual-mode acknowledgment
- Message without "went out" status with acknowledgment
- Message without "went out" status without acknowledgment

|Option|Description|
|---|---|
|"Came in" acknowledgment|Select the check box for a single message with incoming acknowledgment. Came in messages of this message class must be acknowledged. The message remains queued until it is acknowledged.|
|"Went out" acknowledgment|Select the check box for a single message with dual acknowledgment. Went out messages of this message class must be acknowledgment.|
|Flashing on|Select the check box for a new value message with single or dual acknowledgment. The messages of this message class flash when displayed in the message window. For a message block to flash in Runtime, flashing must be activated in the properties of the respective message block.|
|Only for initial value|Select the check box for an initial value message with single acknowledgment. Only the first message of this message class flashes when displayed in the message window. The "Flash On" check box must be selected.|
|Without status "went out"|Select the check box for a message without "Went Out" status with or without acknowledgment. When this option is activated, the messages do not have "Outgoing" status. If the message only recognizes the "Came In" status, the message is not entered in the message window and it is only archived.|
|Unique user|If you select the check box, the comments in the message window are assigned to the logged on user. The user must be registered in the "User name" system block. If no comment is entered, any user can enter the first comment. When the first comment is set, all other users have read-only access to this comment.|
|Comment|If you select the check box, the comment of the "came in" message is always displayed in user text blocks with the dynamic sections "@100%@", "@101%@", "@102%@"," and "@103%@". The display then depends on the status of the message in the message list.|

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.4 Interrupt management

Message handling options

The following methods are available for displaying message traffic in a clearer way or reducing its volume in process mode:

- Filtering alarms via their properties
- Disabling messages
Disabling an individual process tag or a subarea of the hierarchy by means of an OS operation. In PCS 7 this is carried out as the origin of the message, in exactly the same way as an acknowledgment on the block in the AS. Using this type of message suppression, however, does mean that no more events will be output and no associated signal changes will be saved to the message archive. When blocking messages, comments can be entered on the process.
- Smart Alarm Hiding
This function enables interrupts to be hidden automatically in accordance with definable plant states in order to reduce the volume of message traffic in process mode. The advantage of this method is that hidden messages are still archived. The procedure is based on grouping together messages, which, in accordance with the "STATEREP" CFC blocks (PCS 7 Library) and "STRep" (PCS 7 APL), are then assigned to the plant states to be defined. Messages can also be hidden manually.

You can display hidden messages via the "List of hidden messages" and "List of messages to be hidden" message pages.

Note

Information on configuring and on operating and monitoring the Smart Alarm Hiding can be found in the document "PCS 7 in Practice - Smart Alarm Hiding" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/55699984).

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.5 Group display

A particular message from a process picture can be traced across all levels using the group display. The overview area forms the highest level. In this overview, the operator can view messages for every area in a group display.

The messages are only valid in the relevant area. The group displays for an area are linked on a local level by means of a logical OR function and encompass all lower hierarchy levels.

You can branch from the group display (when a newly received, flashing message is present) to the picture tree at just the click of a mouse. The function branches down to the process picture, in which the message can be uniquely assigned. If messages occur in two process pictures at the same time and these pictures are "ORed", the function branches to the first process picture in which the group displays come together.

The group display can contain the following information:

|A|Flashing interrupt signal|(white on red)|
|---|---|---|
|W|Flashing warning|(black on yellow)|
|T|Tolerance|(white on blue, not flashing)|
|S|Flashing error message|(yellow on black)|
|O|Operator request|(white on blue, not flashing)|

# 10.3 Message system

# 10.3.7 Time stamp

Messages are generated in different areas and at various positions within PCS 7. The origin of the message will, therefore, affect its time stamp.

All messages are archived and are displayed in the same way, regardless of their origin. AS and I/O messages are forwarded to the OS servers separately via the plant bus. They already contain the appropriate time stamp. The OS server arranges all messages in the correct order.

To ensure that the correct time stamp is always available, you must configure time synchronization between all the components of the PCS 7 project.

|Origin|Configuration of the message text|Time stamp place of origin|Meaning in PCS 7|
|---|---|---|---|
|Operator station (OS)|In OS "alarm logging"|In the OS|OS system messages|
|Automation system (AS)|In the instances of the function block (e.g. CTRL_PID or MEAS_MON)|In the AS|Process messages and AS system messages from the SIMATIC station|
|Distributed I/O (ET 200SP HA, ET 200M, ET 200iSP, SimcodePro)|In the instances of function block IM_DRV or EventTS|In the I/O|Selected events of the initial value acquisition in the event of a system failure (up to 1 ms accuracy)|

# 10.4 Archiving

# 10.4.1 Introduction

Backing up process values and messages

In a PCS 7 plant, you can archive various types of data which are produced in process mode. This data includes process values (analog and binary) and messages.

PCS 7 provides the option of automatically creating archive tags for process values that are marked accordingly. In order for this to happen, the process values must be labeled as relevant for archiving in the SIMATIC Manager using the "Archive" attribute. This attribute can only be set for block I/Os intended for operator control and monitoring. The available labels, "Archiving" and "Long-term archiving", specify whether the process value should also be saved for the long term if a Process Historian is used. If you have selected the "Create archives" option, PCS 7 then creates the labeled archive tags automatically when the "Compile OS" function is executed.

The recording and archiving times can be adapted to the physical type of the process tag immediately after this step in a clear display (in the SIMATIC Manager process object view, for example).

The individual process tags can be roughly divided into four classes for display purposes:

- Temperature measurement (CT) 10 s to 20 s
- Level measurement (CL) 5 s to 10 s
- Pressure measurement (CP) 3 s to 5 s
- Flow measurement (CF) 0.5 s to 3 s

Depending on how the components have been dimensioned, their values may differ from the example values given here.

By default, archiving is performed locally on the OS servers. The PCS 7 system distinguishes between archive tags which must be archived in intervals of under one minute (TagLogging Fast) and those which must be archived in intervals of over one minute (TagLogging Slow), where one minute is the default setting. The system assigns the tags to two separate archive databases accordingly in online mode. If these archive values are mixed together in the configurable "process value archives" or the system archive, this will not have any effect on the process of assigning them to different databases.

# 10.4 Archiving

The following figure shows the structure of the archives, which are designed as circular logs and use single segments.

The archive values associated with TagLogging Fast and also with TagLogging Slow (as of PCS 7 V7.0) are saved in the database in a compressed state, although this does not impair the quality of the values.

The compression factor which can be achieved depends on a number of factors, particularly on whether or not the archive values can be combined during the acquisition of measured values by means of a sufficiently large hysteresis setting.

Compression ensures that the size of the values will be reduced by a factor of 0.5. This results in a value that is usually around 6 bytes per measured value, but which can sometimes reach up to 16 bytes per measured value.

A message with the maximum number of associated values and comments requires 4 KB. The minimum value for a message is 172 bytes.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.4 Archiving

# Archive settings

The system always offers two criteria for specifying the archive size of a single segment and
the overall size of the circular log:

- Definition of a time period
- Physical size in bytes

If one of these two criteria is exceeded, this will lead to a switch to the next segment in the
case of a single segment, or to the overwriting of the first segment of the entire circular log.
As the total hard disk capacity available for archiving is predefined, the specification in bytes
is the only criterion which is relevant for the entire circular log.

This specification must be standardized for all three archive databases (TagLogging Fast,
TagLogging Slow, and AlarmLogging) in line with the available hard disk capacity.
A time period during which the Tag Logging should be referred back to is set in the practical
implementation. The required memory is roughly calculated.

When using a Process Historian (PH), we also recommend saving the time range required
for the operator in the process mode of typically 1 to 3 months on the OS servers.

# 10.4.2 Archive configuration for TagLogging Fast and TagLogging Slow

# Calculation

Calculation of the memory requirements of all segments for a specified period of y months
for TagLogging Fast:

To perform this calculation, you will need to know how many archive values are saved per
second on average. The archive variables are displayed in a clear form in the process object
view of the SIMATIC Manager. The average archive load can be determined using the
memory cycle of the variables.

The memory requirements for x bytes are generally calculated as follows:

number of archive values/s * x bytes * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * y
months

A specification comprising days or weeks is usually used for a single segment. A segment
change faster than one day may not be used, as this would make the number of segments to
be connected to the MS SQL database when the OS server starts up too large, thus
impairing performance.

Note

As a rule, no more than 200 single segments (for the TagLogging Fast/Slow and
AlarmLogging archive databases) may be generated in total.
The maximum size of a single segment should not exceed 700MB (up to PCS 7 V8.0) or
2GB (from PCS 7 V8.1).
The size of a single segment in bytes can also be calculated using the definition provided
above. It is not the decisive criterion, but it does need to be checked.

Configuration Manual, 03/2018, A5E43228900-AA

# 10.4 Archiving

Example

You are planning on using a period of around 2 months: You have calculated a mean value of 750 archive values/s for TagLogging Fast.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows:
- - Where a memory requirement of 16 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 60 GB

(750 archive values/s * 16 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- Where a memory requirement of 6 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 22 GB

(750 archive values/s * 6 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)

In our example, we have selected 30 GB.

The following is calculated for a single segment per day:

You must then make the following corresponding settings in the "TagLogging Fast" configuration of the "TagLogging" editor:

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.4 Archiving

You proceed in exactly the same way for "TagLogging Slow". You have calculated a mean value of 100 archive values/s for TagLogging Slow.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows:
- - Where a memory requirement of 16 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 8 GB (100 archive values/s * 16 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- Where a memory requirement of 6 bytes per measured value is assumed: approx. 3 GB (100 archive values/s * 6 bytes/value * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)

In our example, we have selected 5 GB.

The following is calculated for a single segment per day:

You must then make the following corresponding settings in the "TagLogging Slow" configuration of the "TagLogging" editor:

# 10.4 Archiving

# 10.4.3 Archive configuration for AlarmLogging

Calculation

Unlike with TagLogging, messages occur as events and you must make assumptions, for example, as regards an average message load which is continuously present. These assumptions can differ from one another considerably, depending on the technology/sector in question.

In practice, however, you can also proceed in another way, by calculating the TagLogging requirement and adding the available, unused hard disk memory space to the AlarmLogging database. This would then become the specification for the maximum size of all segments.

The memory requirements are generally calculated as follows:

Number of messages/s * 4 KB/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * y months

# Example

You assume that the number of events in your plant is 1 message/s.

- The maximum size for all segments is calculated as follows: approx. 20 GB (1 message/s * 4,000 bytes/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 31 days/month * 2 months)
- The following is calculated for a single segment per day: approx. 330 MB (1 message/s * 4,000 bytes/message * 60 s/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 1 day)

Deliberately set this limit higher so that you can still achieve a daily swap-out even if a message burst occurs. In our example, we have selected 700 MB.

Note: As a rule, no more than 200 single segments (for the TagLogging Fast/Slow and AlarmLogging archive databases) may be generated in total.

# 10.4.4.1 Introduction

Process Historian and Information Server

PCS 7 Process Historian (PH) is a long-term archiving server for process data. Tags, alarms and SIMATIC BATCH data can be archived on the PH. The Information Server (IS) can be used to create reports based on the data saved in the PH. In so doing, reports can be created using a web application or a corresponding add-in in an Office application (Excel, Word or PowerPoint).

The following image shows a schematic configuration in the SIMATIC PCS 7 environment:

How the Process Historian and Information Server work

All OS servers and OS single stations for which there is a Process Historian (PH) configured in the PCS 7 project swap out your alarms to the PH in runtime. In addition all OS archive tags identified as "Long-term archiving" are archived on the PH for runtime.

The Information Server (IS) is a web-based reporting system. The IS provides the user with the data from the PH database using the Internet Information Service (IIS).

The following image provides an overview of the Process Historian and Information Server mode of operation:

1. Prompt data archiving of the OS single stations and the OS server on the PH.
2. SIMATIC BATCH swaps out its batch data to the PH in the manner in which this is also available in the BATCH database (native archiving).
3. IS client access to the IS for report creation.

Note
A redundant operation of the PH is possible.

# 10.4.4.2 Process Historian (PH)

Introduction

The Process Historian (PH) is used to archive process values, messages and batch data of the SIMATIC PCS 7 process control system. The process values and messages managed in the PH database can be displayed on OS clients and OS single stations clearly and graphically (with WinCC Alarm or WinCC Trend Control). Data selection is supported by integrated filter functions. Messages and process values can be displayed both in tabular form as well as graphically. The saved data is divided into segments for processing and managing very large amounts of data.

The following picture shows an example of the segmenting setting in the PH:

The MS SQL server is used for the data archiving. The saved archive segments can be saved as a backup file on a hard disk and then deleted (backup/restore). This prevents the memory capacity of the data base hard disk from becoming completely full.

The PH does not need a connection to the plant bus. It can be connected to the OS and Batch Servers of the SIMATIC PCS 7 plant via terminal bus, for example, using the integrated network connection (on-board Ethernet RJ45 port) of the server.

The PH is suitable as long-term data storage for PCS 7 projects. You can swap out the data from multiple projects/multiprojects to a PH.

# Functions of the Process Historian

The PH includes the following functions:

- When the PH is reconfigured, a wizard checks the system requirements (operating system, RAM, HDD, etc.) for PH operation and prevents setup if the requirements are not met.
- All OS process data is available promptly in the PH.
- Batch archives from SIMATIC BATCH are saved with native archiving in the PH.
- The PH also supports single stations.
- The PH supports multiple PCS 7 projects in parallel.
- Access to historical process data via web and Office applications.
- Widely-distributed standard reporting system which is adapted to PCS 7 reporting, including standard report templates.

# Hardware requirements

Using an "IPC 847D" type server is recommended for PCS 7 plants with one OS server and a maximum archiving load of 1,500 values/sec. With intensive use a PH system is not a typical application area for an IPC. For this reason, use of server hardware that offers more options for hard disk configuration is recommended for larger plants.

The hardware assistant "PH-HWAdvisor" assists you in identifying a suitable hardware configuration. You can download the "PH-HWAdvisor" at the following link: https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109740115

To fully integrate the Process Historian in your PCS 7 environment, we recommend that you save the database and segment backups to an iSCSI NAS drive. You can find a relevant example in the "Using an iSCSI network attached storage (NAS) for Process Historian backups" https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/66579062 FAQ.

For additional information regarding the needed PH hardware, refer to the "SIMATIC Process Historian Administration" https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/de/view/109753689 manual.

You can obtain preconfigured PH hardware via the SIEMENS Service "SIMATIC DCS / SCADA Infrastructure" https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109743933.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.5 PCS 7 Web option

# Requirements

The following requirements apply to using the Web solution:

- The Web solution can be implemented both in plants with a server/client structure as well as on OS single stations.
- The Web solution allows Web servers whose plants or plant areas still use a previous version of PCS 7 to also be accessed with a Web client. You will find further information on this in the FAQ "What should you watch out for when installing the PCS 7 Web Option with respect to Web Cross Connectivity?" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/92190315).
- In order to execute a process operation via faceplates, the OS hierarchy (Picture Tree) must be derived from the SIMATIC Manager plant hierarchy. At the very minimum, however, the area names used in the OS and AS must match.

# OS server load

In the case of a plant where the configuration is planned as a mixture of OS clients and Web clients, the permissible number of clients in terms of the load on the OS servers can be roughly calculated using this formula:

Number of OS clients * 2 + number of Web clients * 1 <= 60

# Notes on configuration

The following points must be taken into account when configuring the Web solution:

- Where there is an existing server/client structure, the number of times run through to publish images, scripts and status displays for the Web server is based on the number of server packages downloaded (publishing operations: number of server packages + Web server).
- The "WebNavigator" option must be enabled and selected as the startup screen "@Screen.pd_" for the respective user in the User Administrator of the Web server.
- Different languages, which have been configured in the OS system, can be assigned in the User Administrator for different logon profiles.
- It is also possible to emit an audible signal on a Web client when new messages occur. You can find additional information on this in the "Audible Alarms for PCS 7 Web Clients" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/29088810) application example.

# 10.8 SIMATIC PDM server/client structure

The server/client structure is supported starting in SIMATIC PDM V9.0. This means you can access the interactive PDM portal of the webserver via the browser on a PC or mobile device without SIMATIC software. The PDM portal makes various filters available thanks to the revised process device plant view and allows individual process devices to be retrieved for diagnosis and parameter assignment. The access rights are configured specific to requirements via the PDM Role Management.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.9 User administration

# 10.9.1 User Administrator

# Scope of functions

The "User Administrator" editor of the "WinCC Configuration Studio" is used to establish user
administration.

The editor is used to assign access rights to users for individual editors in the configuration
system and to functions in process mode, as well as to monitor these rights. To this end,
access rights, also known as authorizations, are assigned for OS functions in the User
Administrator. These authorizations can be assigned to individual users or to user groups;
they can also be assigned during process mode.

Other characteristics of the User Administrator:

- Configuration functions for "variable logon", which a user can employ to log on to the OS
client. This can be achieved by means of a variable value, for example, which is set via a
key-operated switch.
- Automatic user logoff after a certain period of time
- User logon via a smart card

|Logon and logoff procedures are to be logged.|Suitable|Not suitable|

SIMATIC Logon is supplied with "Contract License" in SIMATIC PCS 7 V7.1 and above. This means there are no further licensing costs for SIMATIC Logon within PCS 7. As a result, we generally recommend that SIMATIC Logon is used, as it provides more benefits than WinCC Logon and is not associated with any additional costs.

Note: SIMATIC Logon and the User Administrator write different user information to a smart card. SIMATIC Logon also requires the information as to which logon computer or domain controller should be used for user authentication. This is why the Smart card must be specified again with any change from SIMATIC Logon to WinCC Logon or vice-versa.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.9 User administration

# 10.9.2 WinCC Logon

# Method of operation

When a user logs on to the system with a user name and password, the User Administrator checks whether that user has been created in the OS. If the user has not been created, he/she will not be assigned any authorizations in the OS; the same applies if an incorrect password is entered.

This means that the user will not be able to monitor or control the process in process mode. If a properly logged-on user calls an OS functionality which is protected by an authorization, the User Administrator checks whether the relevant authorizations permit this function to be accessed. If the appropriate authorizations are not in place, the User Administrator denies the user access to the requested functionality.

User groups, users, and their passwords are managed in the "User Administrator" editor. The user groups, users, and passwords must be created separately in every OS client. In order to avoid having to duplicate creation work in the OS clients, you can work with referenced OS clients. For referenced OS clients, however, the user administration configurations must be exactly the same for every client.

1. The user logs on to OS client 1.
2. The User Administrator of the OS client 1 checks the user name and password, and determines the authorizations that are met by the user.
3. The user logs on to OS client 2.
4. The User Administrator of the OS client 2 checks the user name and password, and determines the authorizations that are met by the user.

"Logon_Administrator" Windows group

To configure SIMATIC Logon, a Windows group called "Logon_Administrator" is required. In version V1.5 and above this group is set up automatically when installing SIMATIC Logon on the local computer. All users who are stipulated as members of the Windows "Logon_Administrator" group are authorized to access the logon dialog box "Configure SIMATIC Logon".

The following image shows an example of the "Logon_Administrator" group where the user "logon" has been added:

Note

SIMATIC Logon users must be direct members of a Windows group. These users may not be members of a subgroup of a Windows group.

The following image shows an authentication scenario with SIMATIC Logon:

1. The user logs on to OS client 1.
2. The OS client 1 transfers the username and password to SIMATIC Logon Service after logon.
3. The SIMATIC Logon Service transfers the user name and the password to the logon station, to the domain controller, or to the local computer.
4. The logon station, domain controller, or the local computer verifies the user name and password and determines the group membership. This information is passed to the SIMATIC Logon Service.
5. The SIMATIC Logon Service transfers the group membership and informs the OS application if the password was correct.
6. The User Administrator of the OS client 1 determines the user's authorizations if the correct password was entered.

# Configuring OS functions

# 10.9 User administration

Note

If you run SIMATIC Logon with a logon computer, this computer must be available at all times and must not demonstrate any excessive peak loads; Using the ES as the logon computer is not recommended for this reason.

With SIMATIC Logon you can log on via the local computer, irrespective of whether you are working with a logon computer or a domain. We recommend that you create all the necessary users and groups on the local computer also, so that you can still log on to applications when the logon computer or domain are unavailable.

# Configuring user administration

The following steps provide examples of how user management can be configured in association with SIMATIC Logon. The "Operators" group has been created as an example. You will need a valid SIMATIC Logon installation in order to execute the steps.

# Changing projects in process mode

# 11.1 Downloading changes online

Introduction

Once you have inserted new plant objects/pictures and tested their function on the ES, you must update the relevant AS and OS servers to make the changes available to the operator. If no changes have been made to the structure and it is possible to only compile OS changes, the OS servers can remain in runtime mode during the download procedure. Runtime mode must be stopped for a complete download of the OS.

The OS clients are updated automatically. The OS client must be explicitly downloaded only where changes have been made to the OS client project (permissions in the User Administrator, for example). An OS client can only be downloaded in full.

Note

Never make changes to the OS projects on the individual OS servers and OS client stations directly, as you will not be able to use the "Download changes" function. In this event you must execute a complete download.

All changes are made on the ES and are then downloaded to the various OS stations. The redundancy settings for OS servers and the settings for the Web server are exceptions. The background to this and further information on downloading changes can be found in the section "Downloading Changes to a Project" in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

There is an option for displaying the number of changes made via the "Details" button in the dialog box for starting the OS download. Based on the number of changes the system suggests whether downloading the changes is sufficient or whether a complete download needs to be executed.

# Changing projects in process mode

# 11.1 Downloading changes online

# Requirement

You can only download changes online to a PCS 7 OS when runtime mode is activated on the corresponding PC. Both stations must be in runtime mode for redundant servers. In order to use the function for downloading changes online, the entire project must have been compiled and downloaded without errors at least once. Exactly the same project data must have been downloaded in full to redundant OS servers.

# Procedure

The update procedure can be performed in stages or automatically, with the help of the "Compile and Download Objects" dialog box.

# 11.1.1 Compiling and downloading in stages

# Procedure

1. Compile the S7 program in the CFC or SFC editor or in the plan directory of the component view. It makes no difference whether the "Changes only" or "Entire program" option is selected in terms of the AS's capacity to download changes.
2. Download the S7 program into the AS, which is in the RUN-P state, using the "Changes" option.
3. Compile the OS project of the master OS, using the "Changes only" option. This setting also ensures that the server data corresponding to the OS is updated automatically.
4. Download the OS project from the ES to the servers. Once the OS runtime is activated on the target station the "OS-Download" dialog box offers the option of downloading the changes. When downloading changes to a redundant OS server pair, the function first downloads the changes to the configured standby OS. Once this procedure has been executed in full and confirmed with "OK", the process of downloading changes to the configured master OS is started. This order is observed regardless of which of the two OS servers is currently configured as the master.

Note
The steps described should be performed promptly to ensure that no inconsistencies arise for operators between the time when the AS is changed and the time when the OS is changed. Operating staff should also be informed of any pending changes.

# Changing projects in process mode

# 11.1 Downloading changes online

# 11.1.2 Central dialog "Compile and Download Objects"

The "Compile and Download Objects” dialog box can be used to update all SIMATIC stations
automatically, one after the other.

The settings for compiling changes and for downloading changes are made separately for
the relevant objects via the "Edit" button. This calls up the dialogs described in Section
"Compiling and downloading in stages (Page 306)".

The "Test" button can be used to check the consistency of the settings prior to starting the
automatic process.

When changes are downloaded to the OS servers, the OS clients are also updated, as they
receive the new server data.

# 11.1.3 Recommendations

Recommendations for the quantity structure

Only configuring and downloading manageable changes (between 10 and 30 process objects) is recommended for downloading changes online. Downloading changes online is not suitable for transferring mass data but is instead designed for inserting new measuring points or measuring point changes into a project.

# Permitted actions for downloading changes to the OS

An overview of the points where changes can be made can be found in the section "Downloading Changes to a Project" in the "SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 Operator Station" (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109746516) manual.

# 11.2 Complete online download to a redundant OS server pair

# Introduction

You always need to perform a complete download for the initial loading or after performing substantial changes.

# Procedure

The following steps must be taken to download the entire program during operation while retaining data archiving:

1. Compile the OS project (in full or changes only).
2. Download the OS project in full from the ES to the OS servers. The OS runtime on the target station is deactivated automatically with this and the project is closed. The OS runtime is reactivated automatically once the download has completed.
3. After activation, the redundancy manager starts to synchronize the data of the two redundant OS servers. Wait until the process control message "REDRT:Archive update complete" appears.
4. Next download the standby OS. The server already loaded becomes the "Master" again. The OS clients switch over again.
5. If a message appears confirming that the download procedure has been completed successfully, the project has been downloaded in full. After activation, the redundancy manager starts to synchronize the data again. Wait until the process control message "REDRT:Archive update complete" appears.

Note

Both partners should always be downloaded promptly in order to restore the consistency of the configuration data in the redundant system.

# Integrated asset management

# 12.1 Overview

PCS 7 diagnostics and maintenance functions enable you to monitor the various components of a PCS 7 plant and to display its status in process mode. This status is represented by defined icons.

A maintenance station (MS) must be configured in order to make use of these diagnostics and maintenance functions. The basis of an MS is always an OS that provides additional maintenance functions. The maintenance station can be operated as a single station system or as a server in a server-client architecture.

The MS server performs the following basic tasks:

- Provides the diagnostic area with pictures
- Monitoring of all AS components (CPU, distributed I/O, field devices)
- Monitoring of the network components and PC stations
- Monitoring of user-specific devices (with AssetM blocks)

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# 12.2.1 Characteristics for the MS server

The following characteristics apply for the MS server:

- Maintenance Station Standard (integrated in PCS7)
- Licenses required
- Full functionality
- Maintenance Station Basis (integrated in PCS7)
- No licenses required
- Only overview images for CPU objects, PC objects, and network components
- Detailed information cannot be called up (e.g. image blocks)
- Maintenance Station PDM (Stand-alone)
- With special software and hardware bundle only
- Parameter assignment and monitoring of field devices
- Monitoring of PC objects and network objects (optional)

# 12.2.2 Single station system with Maintenance Station (MS)

The ES, OS, and MS are located on the same computer.

Note

In this plant configuration, the OS must be configured as a single station system. You make this setting when creating the project in the SIMATIC Manager, using the "New Project" PCS 7 wizard.

# Integrated asset management

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# 12.2.3 Maintenance Station in flat hierarchies

Starting with PCS 7 V9.0, a Maintenance Station can be used even when OS single user systems with the following configuration are used:

- One redundant OS single-station system (single-station system + single-station system standby)
- Optional: Up to six non-redundant OS single-station systems (as reference OS of the OS single-station system)
- Maintenance Station (MS) as separate PC station

The MS server obtains the data from the automation systems via the redundant OS single-station system. If the redundant OS single-station system is deactivated, the data of the automation systems is no longer displayed. For the display of diagnostic information on the OS single-station systems, a Web server must be configured on the MS server. The diagnostic screens of the MS server can be accessed from the OS single-station system via WebBrowser control.

Note

You can find additional information on configurations of the Maintenance Station in flat architectures in the "SIMATIC PCS 7 Standard Architectures (https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109751791)" manual.

# Integrated asset management

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# 12.2.4 Multiple station system with MS client on the ES

Introduction

The MS client runs directly on the master ES. The current multiproject is stored here. The MS server can be installed on an existing OS server or on a separate computer depending on the size of the plant. The MS server can be configured redundantly. You can provide one MS server for each multiproject. All components in the multiproject is monitored by this server.

- Network card with TCP/IP connection to the plant bus for monitoring via SNMP

Note

Starting with SIMATIC PDM V8.2, SIMATIC PDM is accessed via a PDM Web server in connection with PCS 7. This enables access to a selected field device from any OS client.

# Integrated asset management

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

# Decision support

1. MS server on an existing OS server:
- Plants with 1-2 OS servers
- The OS server must be sufficiently scaled for licenses and performance. Buffers for later expansions must also be figured in.
- The benefit with this option: There is no additional computer required.
- Furthermore only maintenance licenses are required and no additional OS server licenses.
2. MS server as separate computer:
- Plant with three or more servers
- The benefit with this option: Clear assignment for the MS servers to the "diagnostics area" and not to plant areas
- More transparent handling: When the MS server is loaded, for example, this has no effect on the plant areas, which always have to be available to the operator.
- High flexibility due to separation, such as for upgrading the plant

# Integrated asset management

# 12.2 Configurations with Maintenance Station

The data present in the multiproject serves as the basis for asset management (diagnostics blocks, HW Config, system charts with diagnostic blocks and PDM). The names of the components in the diagnostics area are derived from the names of the components in HW Config and PDM. Assign unique names that do not exceed 14 characters.

# Diagnostic structure

The following general steps show how to create a diagnostic structure:

1. Check the "Derive picture hierarchy from the plant hierarchy" option.
2. Check the "Derive diagnostics screens from the plant hierarchy" box.
3. Select a characteristic for the maintenance station.
4. Select the derivation of the PH name.
5. Select the MS server from the OS servers present in the multiproject.
